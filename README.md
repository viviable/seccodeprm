## 📖 Introduction

This month, we saw a huge boost in LLM reasoning power from the verifiable reward (VR)-based Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (ReFT). Previous work has encountered challenges and made unsuccessful attempts in exploring PRM, so we wonder: How far can PRM actually take us? How does it stack up against VR-based methods in reasoning performance, training costs?

To answer these questions, we present **PURE** (**P**rocess-s**U**pervised **R**einforcement l**E**arning). Employing Qwen2.5-Math-7B as the base model, we train a PRM using PRM800K dataset, and then fine-tune another Qwen2.5-Math-7B model using only 8K MATH prompts, process rewards from the PRM, and optional verifiable rewards. For the RL algorithm, we use the PPO loss with an RLOO advantage estimator. We improve credit assignment by using a weighted sum of the process rewards, $\sum_t \text{softmax}(-\text{PR}_t/T)\cdot\text{PR}_t$ which approximates ${\min}_t \text{PR}_t$ when $T\rightarrow 0$, instead of the usual gamma decay sum $\sum_t \gamma^t \cdot \text{PR}_t$ to calculate return. **Our framework supports multiple reward types: only process reward (PURE-PRM), only verifiable reward (PURE-VR) which is the Deepseek-R1-zero's setting, or a mix of both (PURE-PRM+VR)**, as shown in the following table.

📊 The final model achieves pass@1 accuracy of 82.6% on MATH500, 82.5% on AMC, and 53.3% on average across 5 benchmarks, beating Qwen2.5-math-7B-instruct, PRIME, and SimpleRL with just either <1/50th RL data or 1/5th of the compute resources. 

***All results are in pass@1 accuracy***

*The SOTA model was trained using 8K MATH problems, of which only ~800 gave ground-truth final answers that could be used to calculate VRs.

> Note: [Eurus-2-7B-PRIME](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/PRIME), and [SimpleRL-Zero](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/simpleRL-reason) are also based on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B.

## 🔧 Quick Start

We implement our algorithm on two frameworks, OpenRLHF and verl, in 2 different branches respectively. If you are new to our project, we recommend using verl version.

### Installation

#### 1. OpenRLHF version

Please follow [OpenRLHF's guidance](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to configure required environments. Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### 2. verl version

Please refer to the [official installation guidance](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html#install-from-custom-environment) of verl.

### Training of PRM

We train the PRM in 2 stages using [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) and a [preprocessed PRM800K dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/prm800k-trl-dedup). In the first stage, we freeze the LLM and only train the last score layer (MLP) with 1e-4 learning rate rate for 3 epochs. In the second stage, we unfreeze the LLM and fine-tune all parameters with 1e-6 learning rate for 1 epoch. The resultant PRM is released through [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/jinachris/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM800K).

```bash
cd PRM
# stage 1
bash train_stage_1.sh
# stage 2
bash train_stage_2.sh
```

### Training of LLM

#### 1. OpenRLHF version

Switch to the [openrlhf branch](https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE/tree/openrlhf). Run the following command. The parameter `reward_mode` in the [script](https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE/blob/openrlhf/examples/scripts/train_pure.sh) controls the reward type and can be set to `PRM`, `VR`, and `PRMVR`.

```bash
bash examples/scripts/train_pure.sh
```

It uses Ray+vLLM for rollout acceleration, with the first 4 GPUs allocated for the actor, initial actor (reference model), and PRM. The remaining GPUs are used for the vLLM engines. This setup works with 5 to 8 GPUs—just adjust the number of vLLM engines in the script accordingly.

#### 2. verl version

Switch to the [verl branch](https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE/tree/verl). Set the reward type in the [config file](verl/trainer/config/ppo_trainer.yaml):

1. `PURE-VR` uses `reward_model.enable=False reward_model.reward_manager=prime`
2. `PURE-PRM` uses `reward_model.enable=True reward_model.reward_manager=blank`
3. `PURE-PRM+VR` uses `reward_model.enable=True reward_model.reward_manager=prime`.

Then start training:

```bash
python -m verl.trainer.main_ppo
```

The hybrid engine of verl allows for higher gpu utilization compared to the openrlhf version.

### Evaluation

We use [Qwen Math's codebase](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math/tree/main/evaluation) for evaluation (i.e., pass@1 accuracy). For fairness considerations, we completely prohibited solving problems by calling code, following SimpleRL. Please follow the `/eval` instructions for evaluation.

## 📝 TODO:

- [x] re-implementation on [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl)
- [x] paper with more discussions and evaluations
- [ ] attempts to mitigate reward hacking for PRM (Online PURE)
