Wrapper for potentially out-of-band buffersPickleError.__weakref__This takes a binary file for writing a pickle data stream.

The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given
protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The default
protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and is incompatible
with previous versions.

Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol
version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the
version of Python needed to read the pickle produced.

The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a single
bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for binary
writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets
this interface.

If *fix_imports* is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try
to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python
2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.

If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
(such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

It is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*
is None or smaller than 5.Pickler.memoPickler.persistent_idThis takes a binary file for reading a pickle data stream.

The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no
protocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's
representation are ignored.

The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that takes
an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no
arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file* can be a
binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any
other custom object that meets this interface.

Optional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,
which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream
generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to
map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The
*encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string
instances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',
respectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit
string instances as bytes objects.Unpickler.memoUnpickler.persistent_loadOptimized C implementation for the Python pickle module./home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/_pickle.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.soPOSIX shared memory module/home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/_posixshmem.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.soA POSIX helper for the subprocess module./home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/_posixsubprocess.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.soEmpty.__weakref__Simple, unbounded, reentrant FIFO queue.C implementation of the Python queue module.

Functions:

alarm() -- cause SIGALRM after a specified time [Unix only]
setitimer() -- cause a signal (described below) after a specified
               float time and the timer may restart then [Unix only]
getitimer() -- get current value of timer [Unix only]
signal() -- set the action for a given signal
getsignal() -- get the signal action for a given signal
pause() -- wait until a signal arrives [Unix only]
default_int_handler() -- default SIGINT handler

signal constants:
SIG_DFL -- used to refer to the system default handler
SIG_IGN -- used to ignore the signal
NSIG -- number of defined signals
SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc. -- signal numbers

itimer constants:
ITIMER_REAL -- decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon
               expiration
ITIMER_VIRTUAL -- decrements only when the process is executing,
               and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration
ITIMER_PROF -- decrements both when the process is executing and
               when the system is executing on behalf of the process.
               Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually
               used to profile the time spent by the application
               in user and kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon
               expiration.


*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
A signal handler function is called with two arguments:
the first is the signal number, the second is the interrupted stack frame.struct_siginfo: Result from sigwaitinfo or sigtimedwait.

This object may be accessed either as a tuple of
(si_signo, si_code, si_errno, si_pid, si_uid, si_status, si_band),
or via the attributes si_signo, si_code, and so on.socket(family=AF_INET, type=SOCK_STREAM, proto=0) -> socket object
socket(family=-1, type=-1, proto=-1, fileno=None) -> socket object

Open a socket of the given type.  The family argument specifies the
address family; it defaults to AF_INET.  The type argument specifies
whether this is a stream (SOCK_STREAM, this is the default)
or datagram (SOCK_DGRAM) socket.  The protocol argument defaults to 0,
specifying the default protocol.  Keyword arguments are accepted.
The socket is created as non-inheritable.

When a fileno is passed in, family, type and proto are auto-detected,
unless they are explicitly set.

A socket object represents one endpoint of a network connection.

struct format stringStruct.formatstruct size in bytesStruct.sizeFunctions to convert between Python values and C structs.
Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

The variable struct.error is an exception raised on errors.

A lock is not owned by the thread that locked it; another thread may
unlock it.  A thread attempting to lock a lock that it has already locked
will block until another thread unlocks it.  Deadlocks may ensue.ExceptHookArgs

Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.

Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes
    'b'         signed integer     1
    'B'         unsigned integer   1
    'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note)
    'h'         signed integer     2
    'H'         unsigned integer   2
    'i'         signed integer     2
    'I'         unsigned integer   2
    'l'         signed integer     4
    'L'         unsigned integer   4
    'q'         signed integer     8 (see note)
    'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note)
    'f'         floating point     4
    'd'         floating point     8

NOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On
narrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.

NOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform
C compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,
'__int64'.

Afterwards, return every element until the iterable is exhausted.Return those items of iterable for which function(item) is false.

If function is None, return the items that are false.make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable

  iterable
    Elements to divide into groups according to the key function.
  key
    A function for computing the group category for each element.
    If the key function is not specified or is None, the element itself
    is used for grouping.islice(iterable, stop) --> islice object
islice(iterable, start, stop[, step]) --> islice object

Return an iterator whose next() method returns selected values from an
iterable.  If start is specified, will skip all preceding elements;
otherwise, start defaults to zero.  Step defaults to one.  If
specified as another value, step determines how many values are
skipped between successive calls.  Works like a slice() on a list
but returns an iterator.Return an iterator of overlapping pairs taken from the input iterator.

    s -> (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ...Return successive r-length permutations of elements in the iterable.

permutations(range(3), 2) --> (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)product(*iterables, repeat=1) --> product object

Cartesian product of input iterables.  Equivalent to nested for-loops.

For example, product(A, B) returns the same as:  ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).
The leftmost iterators are in the outermost for-loop, so the output tuples
cycle in a manner similar to an odometer (with the rightmost element changing
on every iteration).

To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number
of repetitions with the optional repeat keyword argument. For example,
product(A, repeat=4) means the same as product(A, A, A, A).

product('ab', range(3)) --> ('a',0) ('a',1) ('a',2) ('b',0) ('b',1) ('b',2)
product((0,1), (0,1), (0,1)) --> (0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,1,0) (0,1,1) (1,0,0) ...repeat(object [,times]) -> create an iterator which returns the object
for the specified number of times.  If not specified, returns the object
endlessly.Return an iterator whose values are returned from the function evaluated with an argument tuple taken from the given sequence.Return successive entries from an iterable as long as the predicate evaluates to true for each entry.zip_longest(iter1 [,iter2 [...]], [fillvalue=None]) --> zip_longest object

Return a zip_longest object whose .__next__() method returns a tuple where
the i-th element comes from the i-th iterable argument.  The .__next__()
method continues until the longest iterable in the argument sequence
is exhausted and then it raises StopIteration.  When the shorter iterables
are exhausted, the fillvalue is substituted in their place.  The fillvalue
defaults to None or can be specified by a keyword argument.
pgen2.literalsThis module contains functions that can read and write Python values in
a binary format. The format is specific to Python, but independent of
machine architecture issues.

Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects
whose value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be
written and read by this module. The following types are supported:
None, integers, floating point numbers, strings, bytes, bytearrays,
tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, and code objects, where it
should be understood that tuples, lists and dictionaries are only
supported as long as the values contained therein are themselves
supported; and recursive lists and dictionaries should not be written
(they will cause infinite loops).

Variables:

version -- indicates the format that the module uses. Version 0 is the
    historical format, version 1 shares interned strings and version 2
    uses a binary format for floating point numbers.
    Version 3 shares common object references (New in version 3.4).

Functions:

dump() -- write value to a file
load() -- read value from a file
dumps() -- marshal value as a bytes object
loads() -- read value from a bytes-like objectThis module provides access to the mathematical functions
defined by the C standard./home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/math.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.sosupport.os_helperpgen2.parsepgen2.pgenThis module provides access to operating system functionality that is

It is available on all Unix versions.

Password database entries are reported as 7-tuples containing the following
items from the password database (see `<pwd.h>'), in order:
pw_name, pw_passwd, pw_uid, pw_gid, pw_gecos, pw_dir, pw_shell.
The uid and gid items are integers, all others are strings. An
exception is raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.pwd.struct_passwd: Results from getpw*() routines.

This object may be accessed either as a tuple of
  (pw_name,pw_passwd,pw_uid,pw_gid,pw_gecos,pw_dir,pw_shell)

*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
On Windows, only sockets are supported; on Unix, all file descriptors./home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/select.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.soselect.epoll(sizehint=-1, flags=0)

Returns an epolling object

sizehint must be a positive integer or -1 for the default size. The
sizehint is used to optimize internal data structures. It doesn't limit
the maximum number of monitored events.True if the epoll handler is closedepoll.closedThis module provides an interface to the Posix calls for tty I/O control.
For a complete description of these calls, see the Posix or Unix manual
pages. It is only available for those Unix versions that support Posix
termios style tty I/O control.

All functions in this module take a file descriptor fd as their first
argument. This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by
sys.stdin.fileno(), or a file object, such as sys.stdin itself./home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/termios.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.sosupport.testresultfutures.threadThis module provides various functions to manipulate time values.

There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.
The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).

The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (including century, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.
The time value as returned by gmtime(), localtime(), and strptime(), and
 accepted by asctime(), mktime() and strftime().  May be considered as a
 sequence of 9 integers.

 Note that several fields' values are not the same as those defined by
 the C language standard for struct tm.  For example, the value of the
 field tm_year is the actual year, not year - 1900.  See individual
 fields' descriptions for details.pgen2.tokenpgen2.tokenizeThis module provides access to the Unicode Character Database which
defines character properties for all Unicode characters. The data in
this database is based on the UnicodeData.txt file version
13.0.0 which is publicly available from ftp://ftp.unicode.org/.

The module uses the same names and symbols as defined by the
UnicodeData File Format 13.0.0./home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/unicodedata.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so13.0.01.2.13The functions in this module allow compression and decompression using the
zlib library, which is based on GNU zip.

adler32(string[, start]) -- Compute an Adler-32 checksum.
compress(data[, level]) -- Compress data, with compression level 0-9 or -1.
compressobj([level[, ...]]) -- Return a compressor object.
crc32(string[, start]) -- Compute a CRC-32 checksum.
decompress(string,[wbits],[bufsize]) -- Decompresses a compressed string.
decompressobj([wbits[, zdict]]) -- Return a decompressor object.

'wbits' is window buffer size and container format.
Compressor objects support compress() and flush() methods; decompressor
objects support decompress() and flush()./home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/zlib.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.sounittest._logmultiprocessing.managersmultiprocessing.poolmultiprocessing.sharedctypesmultiprocessing.popen_spawn_posixmultiprocessing.popen_forkservermultiprocessing.popen_spawn_win32multiprocessing.heapbuiltin-class

 XML is an inherently hierarchical data format, and the most natural way to
 represent it is with a tree.  This module has two classes for this purpose:

    1. ElementTree represents the whole XML document as a tree and

    2. Element represents a single node in this tree.

 Interactions with the whole document (reading and writing to/from files) are
 usually done on the ElementTree level.  Interactions with a single XML element
 and its sub-elements are done on the Element level.

 Element is a flexible container object designed to store hierarchical data
 structures in memory. It can be described as a cross between a list and a
 dictionary.  Each Element has a number of properties associated with it:

    'tag' - a string containing the element's name.

    'attributes' - a Python dictionary storing the element's attributes.

    'text' - a string containing the element's text content.

    'tail' - an optional string containing text after the element's end tag.

    And a number of child elements stored in a Python sequence.

 To create an element instance, use the Element constructor,
 or the SubElement factory function.

 You can also use the ElementTree class to wrap an element structure
 and convert it to and from XML.

    In addition to its exception value, a ParseError contains
    two extra attributes:
        'code'     - the specific exception code
        'position' - the line and column of the error

    ''element''Return True if *element* appears to be an Element.''An XML element.

    This class is the reference implementation of the Element interface.

    An element's length is its number of subelements.  That means if you
    want to check if an element is truly empty, you should check BOTH
    its length AND its text attribute.

    The element tag, attribute names, and attribute values can be either
    bytes or strings.

    *tag* is the element name.  *attrib* is an optional dictionary containing
    element attributes. *extra* are additional element attributes given as
    keyword arguments.

    Example form:
        <tag attrib>text<child/>...</tag>tail

    ''The element's name.''Dictionary of the element's attributes.''
    Text before first subelement. This is either a string or the value None.
    Note that if there is no text, this attribute may be either
    None or the empty string, depending on the parser.

    ''
    Text after this element's end tag, but before the next sibling element's
    start tag.  This is either a string or the value None.  Note that if there
    was no text, this attribute may be either None or an empty string,
    depending on the parser.

    ''extra''attrib must be dict, not %s''<%s %r at %#x>''Create a new element with the same type.

        *tag* is a string containing the element name.
        *attrib* is a dictionary containing the element attributes.

        Do not call this method, use the SubElement factory function instead.

        ''Return copy of current element.

        This creates a shallow copy. Subelements will be shared with the
        original tree.

        ''warn''elem.copy() is deprecated. Use copy.copy(elem) instead.''__copy__''The behavior of this method will change in future versions.  Use specific 'len(elem)' or 'elem is not None' test instead.''Add *subelement* to the end of this element.

        The new element will appear in document order after the last existing
        subelement (or directly after the text, if it's the first subelement),
        but before the end tag for this element.

        ''Append subelements from a sequence.

        *elements* is a sequence with zero or more elements.

        ''Insert *subelement* at position *index*.''expected an Element, not %s''Remove matching subelement.

        Unlike the find methods, this method compares elements based on
        identity, NOT ON tag value or contents.  To remove subelements by
        other means, the easiest way is to use a list comprehension to
        select what elements to keep, and then use slice assignment to update
        the parent element.

        ValueError is raised if a matching element could not be found.

        ''Find first matching element by tag name or path.

        *path* is a string having either an element tag or an XPath,
        *namespaces* is an optional mapping from namespace prefix to full name.

        Return the first matching element, or None if no element was found.

        ''Find text for first matching element by tag name or path.

        *path* is a string having either an element tag or an XPath,
        *default* is the value to return if the element was not found,
        *namespaces* is an optional mapping from namespace prefix to full name.

        Return text content of first matching element, or default value if
        none was found.  Note that if an element is found having no text
        content, the empty string is returned.

        ''Find all matching subelements by tag name or path.

        *path* is a string having either an element tag or an XPath,
        *namespaces* is an optional mapping from namespace prefix to full name.

        Returns list containing all matching elements in document order.

        ''Find all matching subelements by tag name or path.

        *path* is a string having either an element tag or an XPath,
        *namespaces* is an optional mapping from namespace prefix to full name.

        Return an iterable yielding all matching elements in document order.

        ''Reset element.

        This function removes all subelements, clears all attributes, and sets
        the text and tail attributes to None.

        ''Get element attribute.

        Equivalent to attrib.get, but some implementations may handle this a
        bit more efficiently.  *key* is what attribute to look for, and
        *default* is what to return if the attribute was not found.

        Returns a string containing the attribute value, or the default if
        attribute was not found.

        ''Set element attribute.

        Equivalent to attrib[key] = value, but some implementations may handle
        this a bit more efficiently.  *key* is what attribute to set, and
        *value* is the attribute value to set it to.

        ''Get list of attribute names.

        Names are returned in an arbitrary order, just like an ordinary
        Python dict.  Equivalent to attrib.keys()

        ''Get element attributes as a sequence.

        The attributes are returned in arbitrary order.  Equivalent to
        attrib.items().

        Return a list of (name, value) tuples.

        ''Create tree iterator.

        The iterator loops over the element and all subelements in document
        order, returning all elements with a matching tag.

        If the tree structure is modified during iteration, new or removed
        elements may or may not be included.  To get a stable set, use the
        list() function on the iterator, and loop over the resulting list.

        *tag* is what tags to look for (default is to return all elements)

        Return an iterator containing all the matching elements.

        ''Create text iterator.

        order, returning all inner text.

        ''t''Subelement factory which creates an element instance, and appends it
    to an existing parent.

    The element tag, attribute names, and attribute values can be either
    bytes or Unicode strings.

    *parent* is the parent element, *tag* is the subelements name, *attrib* is
    an optional directory containing element attributes, *extra* are
    additional attributes given as keyword arguments.

    ''Comment element factory.

    serializes as an XML comment.

    *text* is a string containing the comment string.

    ''Processing Instruction element factory.

    This function creates a special element which the standard serializer
    serializes as an XML comment.

    *target* is a string containing the processing instruction, *text* is a
    string containing the processing instruction contents, if any.

    ''Qualified name wrapper.

    This class can be used to wrap a QName attribute value in order to get
    proper namespace handing on output.

    *text_or_uri* is a string containing the QName value either in the form
    {uri}local, or if the tag argument is given, the URI part of a QName.

    *tag* is an optional argument which if given, will make the first
    argument (text_or_uri) be interpreted as a URI, and this argument (tag)
    be interpreted as a local name.

    ''<%s %r>''other''An XML element hierarchy.

    This class also provides support for serialization to and from
    standard XML.

Each line is of the form:

    FeatureName = "_Feature(" OptionalRelease "," MandatoryRelease ","
                              CompilerFlag ")"

where, normally, OptionalRelease < MandatoryRelease, and both are 5-tuples
of the same form as sys.version_info:

    (PY_MAJOR_VERSION, # the 2 in 2.1.0a3; an int
     PY_MINOR_VERSION, # the 1; an int
     PY_MICRO_VERSION, # the 0; an int
     PY_RELEASE_LEVEL, # "alpha", "beta", "candidate" or "final"; string
     PY_RELEASE_SERIAL # the 3; an int
    )

OptionalRelease records the first release in which

    from __future__ import FeatureName

was accepted.

In the case of MandatoryReleases that have not yet occurred,
MandatoryRelease predicts the release in which the feature will become part
of the language.

Else MandatoryRelease records when the feature became part of the language;
in releases at or after that, modules no longer need

    from __future__ import FeatureName

to use the feature in question, but may continue to use such imports.

MandatoryRelease may also be None, meaning that a planned feature got
dropped.

Instances of class _Feature have two corresponding methods,
.getOptionalRelease() and .getMandatoryRelease().

CompilerFlag is the (bitfield) flag that should be passed in the fourth
argument to the builtin function compile() to enable the feature in
dynamically compiled code.  This flag is stored in the .compiler_flag
attribute on _Future instances.  These values must match the appropriate
#defines of CO_xxx flags in Include/cpython/compile.h.

No feature line is ever to be deleted from this file.

Python unit testing framework, based on Erich Gamma's JUnit and Kent Beck's
Smalltalk testing framework (used with permission).

This module contains the core framework classes that form the basis of
specific test cases and suites (TestCase, TestSuite etc.), and also a
text-based utility class for running the tests and reporting the results
 (TextTestRunner).

Simple usage:

    import unittest

    class IntegerArithmeticTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def testAdd(self):  # test method names begin with 'test'
            self.assertEqual((1 + 2), 3)
            self.assertEqual(0 + 1, 1)
        def testMultiply(self):
            self.assertEqual((0 * 10), 0)
            self.assertEqual((5 * 8), 40)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

    Standard Python encoding modules are stored in this package
    directory.

    Codec modules must have names corresponding to normalized encoding
    names as defined in the normalize_encoding() function below, e.g.
    'utf-8' must be implemented by the module 'utf_8.py'.

    Each codec module must export the following interface:

    * getregentry() -> codecs.CodecInfo object
    The getregentry() API must return a CodecInfo object with encoder, decoder,
    incrementalencoder, incrementaldecoder, streamwriter and streamreader
    attributes which adhere to the Python Codec Interface Standard.

    In addition, a module may optionally also define the following
    APIs which are then used by the package's codec search function:

    * getaliases() -> sequence of encoding name strings to use as aliases

    Alias names returned by getaliases() must be normalized encoding
    names as defined by normalize_encoding().

    Formatter instances are used to convert a LogRecord to text.

    Formatters need to know how a LogRecord is constructed. They are
    responsible for converting a LogRecord to (usually) a string which can
    be interpreted by either a human or an external system. The base Formatter
    allows a formatting string to be specified. If none is supplied, the
    style-dependent default value, "%(message)s", "{message}", or
    "${message}", is used.

    The Formatter can be initialized with a format string which makes use of
    knowledge of the LogRecord attributes - e.g. the default value mentioned
    above makes use of the fact that the user's message and arguments are pre-
    formatted into a LogRecord's message attribute. Currently, the useful
    attributes in a LogRecord are described by:

    %(name)s            Name of the logger (logging channel)
    %(levelno)s         Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO,
                        WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    %(levelname)s       Text logging level for the message ("DEBUG", "INFO",
                        "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL")
    %(pathname)s        Full pathname of the source file where the logging
                        call was issued (if available)
    %(filename)s        Filename portion of pathname
    %(module)s          Module (name portion of filename)
    %(lineno)d          Source line number where the logging call was issued
                        (if available)
    %(funcName)s        Function name
    %(created)f         Time when the LogRecord was created (time.time()
                        return value)
    %(asctime)s         Textual time when the LogRecord was created
    %(msecs)d           Millisecond portion of the creation time
    %(relativeCreated)d Time in milliseconds when the LogRecord was created,
                        relative to the time the logging module was loaded
                        (typically at application startup time)
    %(thread)d          Thread ID (if available)
    %(threadName)s      Thread name (if available)
    %(process)d         Process ID (if available)
    %(message)s         The result of record.getMessage(), computed just as
                        the record is emitted
    ''datefmt''
        Initialize the formatter with specified format strings.

        Initialize the formatter either with the specified format string, or a
        default as described above. Allow for specialized date formatting with
        the optional datefmt argument. If datefmt is omitted, you get an
        ISO8601-like (or RFC 3339-like) format.

        Use a style parameter of '%', '{' or '$' to specify that you want to
        use one of %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` (``{}``) formatting or
        :class:`string.Template` formatting in your format string.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.2
           Added the ``style`` parameter.
        ''Style must be one of: %s''%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S''%s,%03d''
        Return the creation time of the specified LogRecord as formatted text.

        This method should be called from format() by a formatter which
        wants to make use of a formatted time. This method can be overridden
        in formatters to provide for any specific requirement, but the
        basic behaviour is as follows: if datefmt (a string) is specified,
        it is used with time.strftime() to format the creation time of the
        record. Otherwise, an ISO8601-like (or RFC 3339-like) format is used.
        The resulting string is returned. This function uses a user-configurable
        function to convert the creation time to a tuple. By default,
        time.localtime() is used; to change this for a particular formatter
        instance, set the 'converter' attribute to a function with the same
        signature as time.localtime() or time.gmtime(). To change it for all
        formatters, for example if you want all logging times to be shown in GMT,
        set the 'converter' attribute in the Formatter class.
        ''
        Format and return the specified exception information as a string.

        This default implementation just uses

        Check if the format uses the creation time of the record.
        ''
        This method is provided as an extension point for specialized
        formatting of stack information.

        The input data is a string as returned from a call to
        :func:`traceback.print_stack`, but with the last trailing newline
        removed.

        The base implementation just returns the value passed in.
        ''
        Format the specified record as text.

        The record's attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a
        string formatting operation which yields the returned string.
        Before formatting the dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps
        are carried out. The message attribute of the record is computed
        using LogRecord.getMessage(). If the formatting string uses the
        time (as determined by a call to usesTime(), formatTime() is
        called to format the event time. If there is exception information,
        it is formatted using formatException() and appended to the message.
        ''asctime''
    A formatter suitable for formatting a number of records.
    ''
        Optionally specify a formatter which will be used to format each
        individual record.
        ''
        Return the header string for the specified records.
        ''
        Return the footer string for the specified records.
        ''
        Format the specified records and return the result as a string.
        ''
    Filter instances are used to perform arbitrary filtering of LogRecords.

    Loggers and Handlers can optionally use Filter instances to filter
    records as desired. The base filter class only allows events which are
    below a certain point in the logger hierarchy. For example, a filter
    initialized with "A.B" will allow events logged by loggers "A.B",
    "A.B.C", "A.B.C.D", "A.B.D" etc. but not "A.BB", "B.A.B" etc. If
    initialized with the empty string, all events are passed.
    ''
        Initialize a filter.

        Initialize with the name of the logger which, together with its
        children, will have its events allowed through the filter. If no
        name is specified, allow every event.
        ''
        Determine if the specified record is to be logged.

        Returns True if the record should be logged, or False otherwise.
        If deemed appropriate, the record may be modified in-place.
        ''
    A base class for loggers and handlers which allows them to share
    common code.
    ''
        Initialize the list of filters to be an empty list.
        ''
        Add the specified filter to this handler.
        ''
        Remove the specified filter from this handler.
        ''
        Determine if a record is loggable by consulting all the filters.

        The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto
        this and the record is then dropped. Returns a zero value if a record
        is to be dropped, else non-zero.

    the 'raw' message as determined by record.message is logged.

        This version removes the handler from an internal map of handlers,
        _handlers, which is used for handler lookup by name. Subclasses
        should ensure that this gets called from overridden close()
        methods.
        ''
        Handle errors which occur during an emit() call.

        This method should be called from handlers when an exception is
        encountered during an emit() call. If raiseExceptions is false,
        exceptions get silently ignored. This is what is mostly wanted
        for a logging system - most users will not care about errors in
        the logging system, they are more interested in application errors.
        You could, however, replace this with a custom handler if you wish.
        The record which was being processed is passed in to this method.

        traceback.print_exception and appended to the stream.  If the stream
        has an 'encoding' attribute, it is used to determine how to do the
        output to the stream.

    Instances of the Logger class represent a single logging channel. A
    "logging channel" indicates an area of an application. Exactly how an
    "area" is defined is up to the application developer. Since an
    application can have any number of areas, logging channels are identified
    by a unique string. Application areas can be nested (e.g. an area
    of "input processing" might include sub-areas "read CSV files", "read
    XLS files" and "read Gnumeric files"). To cater for this natural nesting,
    channel names are organized into a namespace hierarchy where levels are
    separated by periods, much like the Java or Python package namespace. So
    in the instance given above, channel names might be "input" for the upper
    level, and "input.csv", "input.xls" and "input.gnu" for the sub-levels.
    There is no arbitrary limit to the depth of nesting.

    Do basic configuration for the logging system.

    This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
    configured, unless the keyword argument *force* is set to ``True``.
    It is a convenience method intended for use by simple scripts
    to do one-shot configuration of the logging package.

    The default behaviour is to create a StreamHandler which writes to
    sys.stderr, set a formatter using the BASIC_FORMAT format string, and
    add the handler to the root logger.

    A number of optional keyword arguments may be specified, which can alter
    the default behaviour.

    filename  Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified
              filename, rather than a StreamHandler.
    filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified
              (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
    format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
    datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
    style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the
              type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for
              %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template`
              - defaults to '%').
    level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
    stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note
              that this argument is incompatible with 'filename' - if both
              are present, 'stream' is ignored.
    handlers  If specified, this should be an iterable of already created
              handlers, which will be added to the root handler. Any handler
              in the list which does not have a formatter assigned will be
              assigned the formatter created in this function.
    force     If this keyword  is specified as true, any existing handlers
              attached to the root logger are removed and closed, before
              carrying out the configuration as specified by the other
              arguments.
    encoding  If specified together with a filename, this encoding is passed to
              the created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened.
    errors    If specified together with a filename, this value is passed to the
              created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened in text mode. If not specified, the default value is
              `backslashreplace`.

    Note that you could specify a stream created using open(filename, mode)
    rather than passing the filename and mode in. However, it should be
    remembered that StreamHandler does not close its stream (since it may be
    using sys.stdout or sys.stderr), whereas FileHandler closes its stream
    when the handler is closed.

    This handler does nothing. It's intended to be used to avoid the
    "No handlers could be found for logger XXX" one-off warning. This is
    important for library code, which may contain code to log events. If a user
    of the library does not configure logging, the one-off warning might be
    produced; to avoid this, the library developer simply needs to instantiate
    a NullHandler and add it to the top-level logger of the library module or
    package.

Tkinter provides classes which allow the display, positioning and
control of widgets. Toplevel widgets are Tk and Toplevel. Other
widgets are Frame, Label, Entry, Text, Canvas, Button, Radiobutton,
Checkbutton, Scale, Listbox, Scrollbar, OptionMenu, Spinbox
LabelFrame and PanedWindow.

Properties of the widgets are specified with keyword arguments.
Keyword arguments have the same name as the corresponding resource
under Tk.

Widgets are positioned with one of the geometry managers Place, Pack
or Grid. These managers can be called with methods place, pack, grid
available in every Widget.

Actions are bound to events by resources (e.g. keyword argument
command) or with the method bind.

Example (Hello, World):
import tkinter
from tkinter.constants import *
tk = tkinter.Tk()
frame = tkinter.Frame(tk, relief=RIDGE, borderwidth=2)
frame.pack(fill=BOTH,expand=1)
label = tkinter.Label(frame, text="Hello, World")
label.pack(fill=X, expand=1)
button = tkinter.Button(frame,text="Exit",command=tk.destroy)
button.pack(side=BOTTOM)

    If a callback function for one of these events is registered
    using bind, bind_all, bind_class, or tag_bind, the callback is
    called with an Event as first argument. It will have the
    following attributes (in braces are the event types for which
    the attribute is valid):

        <Control-Button-1> for pressing Control and mouse button 1 or
        <Alt-A> for pressing A and the Alt key (KeyPress can be omitted).
        An event pattern can also be a virtual event of the form
        <<AString>> where AString can be arbitrary. This
        event can be generated by event_generate.
        If events are concatenated they must appear shortly
        after each other.

        FUNC will be called if the event sequence occurs with an
        instance of Event as argument. If the return value of FUNC is
        "break" no further bound function is invoked.

        An additional boolean parameter ADD specifies whether FUNC will
        be called additionally to the other bound function or whether
        it will replace the previous function.

        Bind will return an identifier to allow deletion of the bound function with
        unbind without memory leak.

        ''panedwindow''Add a child widget to the panedwindow in a new pane.

        The child argument is the name of the child widget
        followed by pairs of arguments that specify how to

        If the point is over a sash or a sash handle, the result
        is a two element list containing the index of the sash or
        handle, and a word indicating whether it is over a sash

        Option may be any value allowed by the paneconfigure subcommand
        ''paneconfigure''Query or modify the management options for window.

        If no option is specified, returns a list describing all
        of the available options for pathName.  If option is
        specified with no value, then the command returns a list
        describing the one named option (this list will be identical
        to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
        option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
        specified, then the command modifies the given widget
        option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
        command returns an empty string. The following options
        are supported:

        after window
            Insert the window after the window specified. window
            should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.
        before window
            Insert the window before the window specified. window
            should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.
        height size
            Specify a height for the window. The height will be the
            outer dimension of the window including its border, if
            any. If size is an empty string, or if -height is not
            specified, then the height requested internally by the
            window will be used initially; the height may later be
            adjusted by the movement of sashes in the panedwindow.
            Size may be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        minsize n
            Specifies that the size of the window cannot be made
            less than n. This constraint only affects the size of
            the widget in the paned dimension -- the x dimension
            for horizontal panedwindows, the y dimension for
            vertical panedwindows. May be any value accepted by
            Tk_GetPixels.
        padx n
            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the X-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        pady n
            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the Y-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        sticky style
            If a window's pane is larger than the requested
            dimensions of the window, this option may be used
            to position (or stretch) the window within its pane.
            Style is a string that contains zero or more of the
            characters n, s, e or w. The string can optionally
            contains spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each
            letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or west)
            that the window will "stick" to. If both n and s
            (or e and w) are specified, the window will be
            stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of
            its cavity.
        width size
            Specify a width for the window. The width will be
            the outer dimension of the window including its
            border, if any. If size is an empty string, or
            if -width is not specified, then the width requested
            internally by the window will be used initially; the
            width may later be adjusted by the movement of sashes
            in the panedwindow. Size may be any value accepted by
            Tk_GetPixels.

Lib/ctypes.util.find_library() support for AIX
Similar approach as done for Darwin support by using separate files
but unlike Darwin - no extension such as ctypes.macholib.*

dlopen() is an interface to AIX initAndLoad() - primary documentation at:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/dlopen.htm
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/load.htm

AIX supports two styles for dlopen(): svr4 (System V Release 4) which is common on posix
platforms, but also a BSD style - aka SVR3.

From AIX 5.3 Difference Addendum (December 2004)
2.9 SVR4 linking affinity
Nowadays, there are two major object file formats used by the operating systems:
XCOFF: The COFF enhanced by IBM and others. The original COFF (Common
Object File Format) was the base of SVR3 and BSD 4.2 systems.
ELF:   Executable and Linking Format that was developed by AT&T and is a
base for SVR4 UNIX.

While the shared library content is identical on AIX - one is located as a filepath name
(svr4 style) and the other is located as a member of an archive (and the archive
is located as a filepath name).

The key difference arises when supporting multiple abi formats (i.e., 32 and 64 bit).
For svr4 either only one ABI is supported, or there are two directories, or there
are different file names. The most common solution for multiple ABI is multiple
directories.

For the XCOFF (aka AIX) style - one directory (one archive file) is sufficient
as multiple shared libraries can be in the archive - even sharing the same name.
In documentation the archive is also referred to as the "base" and the shared
library object is referred to as the "member".

For dlopen() on AIX (read initAndLoad()) the calls are similar.
Default activity occurs when no path information is provided. When path
information is provided dlopen() does not search any other directories.

For SVR4 - the shared library name is the name of the file expected: libFOO.so
For AIX - the shared library is expressed as base(member). The search is for the
base (e.g., libFOO.a) and once the base is found the shared library - identified by
member (e.g., libFOO.so, or shr.o) is located and loaded.

The mode bit RTLD_MEMBER tells initAndLoad() that it needs to use the AIX (SVR3)
naming style.
''Michael Felt <aixtools@felt.demon.nl>''./''../''INDEX''[0-9]''
    Parse the header of the loader section of executable and archives
    This function calls /usr/bin/dump -H as a subprocess
    and returns a list of (ld_header, ld_header_info) tuples.
    ''/usr/bin/dump''-X''-H''universal_newlines''
    extract the shareable objects from ld_headers
    character "[" is used to strip off the path information.
    Note: the "[" and "]" characters that are part of dump -H output
    are not removed here.
    ''shared''
    Must be only one match, otherwise result is None.
    When there is a match, strip leading "[" and trailing "]"
    ''\[('')\]''
    This routine provides historical aka legacy naming schemes started
    in AIX4 shared library support for library members names.
    e.g., in /usr/lib/libc.a the member name shr.o for 32-bit binary and
    shr_64.o for 64-bit binary.
    ''shr4?_?64\.o''shr.o''shr4.o''
    Sort list of members and return highest numbered version - if it exists.
    This function is called when an unversioned libFOO.a(libFOO.so) has
    not been found.

    Versioning for the member name is expected to follow
    GNU LIBTOOL conventions: the highest version (x, then X.y, then X.Y.z)
     * find [libFoo.so.X]
     * find [libFoo.so.X.Y]
     * find [libFoo.so.X.Y.Z]

    Before the GNU convention became the standard scheme regardless of
    binary size AIX packagers used GNU convention "as-is" for 32-bit
    archive members but used an "distinguishing" name for 64-bit members.
    This scheme inserted either 64 or _64 between libFOO and .so
    - generally libFOO_64.so, but occasionally libFOO64.so
    ''lib''\.so\.[0-9]+[0-9.]*''_?64\.so\.[0-9]+[0-9.]*''
    Return an archive member matching the request in name.
    Name is the library name without any prefix like lib, suffix like .so,
    or version number.
    Given a list of members find and return the most appropriate result
    Priority is given to generic libXXX.so, then a versioned libXXX.so.a.b.c
    and finally, legacy AIX naming scheme.
    ''\.so''64\.so''
    On AIX, the buildtime searchpath is stored in the executable.
    as "loader header information".
    The command /usr/bin/dump -H extracts this info.
    Prefix searched libraries with LD_LIBRARY_PATH (preferred),
    or LIBPATH if defined. These paths are appended to the paths
    to libraries the python executable is linked with.
    This mimics AIX dlopen() behavior.
    ''LD_LIBRARY_PATH''LIBPATH''objects''
    paths is a list of directories to search for an archive.
    name is the abbreviated name given to find_library().
    Process: search "paths" for archive, and if an archive is found
    return the result of get_member().
    If an archive is not found then return None
    ''/lib''.a''AIX implementation of ctypes.util.find_library()
    Find an archive member that will dlopen(). If not available,
    also search for a file (or link) with a .so suffix.

    AIX supports two types of schemes that can be used with dlopen().
    The so-called SystemV Release4 (svr4) format is commonly suffixed
    with .so while the (default) AIX scheme has the library (archive)
    ending with the suffix .a
    As an archive has multiple members (e.g., 32-bit and 64-bit) in one file
    the argument passed to dlopen must include both the library and
    the member names in a single string.

    find_library() looks first for an archive (.a) with a suitable member.
    If no archive+member pair is found, look for a .so file.
    ''.so''Shared AIX support functions.''aix-{:1x}{:1d}{:02d}-{:04d}-{}''tl''
    Return a Tuple[str, int] e.g., ['7.1.4.34', 1806]
    The fileset bos.mp64 is the AIX kernel. It's VRMF and builddate
    reflect the current ABI levels of the runtime environment.
    ''/usr/bin/lslpp''-Lqc''bos.mp64''
    AIX filesets are identified by four decimal values: V.R.M.F.
    V (version) and R (release) can be retreived using ``uname``
    Since 2007, starting with AIX 5.3 TL7, the M value has been
    included with the fileset bos.mp64 and represents the Technology
    Level (TL) of AIX. The F (Fix) value also increases, but is not
    relevant for comparing releases and binary compatibility.
    For binary compatibility the so-called builddate is needed.
    Again, the builddate of an AIX release is associated with bos.mp64.
    AIX ABI compatibility is described  as guaranteed at: https://www.ibm.com/    support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_72/install/binary_compatability.html

    For pep425 purposes the AIX platform tag becomes:
    "aix-{:1x}{:1d}{:02d}-{:04d}-{}".format(v, r, tl, builddate, bitsize)
    e.g., "aix-6107-1415-32" for AIX 6.1 TL7 bd 1415, 32-bit
    and, "aix-6107-1415-64" for AIX 6.1 TL7 bd 1415, 64-bit

    Iterate on the list *fs*, yielding finished futures one by one in
    reverse order.
    Before yielding a future, *waiter* is removed from its waiters
    and the future is removed from each set in the collection of sets
    *ref_collect*.

    The aim of this function is to avoid keeping stale references after
    the future is yielded and before the iterator resumes.
    ''An iterator over the given futures that yields each as it completes.

            is no limit on the wait time.

    Returns:
        An iterator that yields the given Futures as they complete (finished or
        cancelled). If any given Futures are duplicated, they will be returned
        once.

            FIRST_EXCEPTION - Return when any future finishes by raising an
                              exception. If no future raises an exception
                              then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.
            ALL_COMPLETED -   Return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

    Returns:
        A named 2-tuple of sets. The first set, named 'done', contains the
        futures that completed (is finished or cancelled) before the wait
        completed. The second set, named 'not_done', contains uncompleted

    A module's spec is the source for information about the module.  For
    data associated with the module, including source, use the spec's
    loader.

    `name` is the absolute name of the module.  `loader` is the loader
    to use when loading the module.  `parent` is the name of the
    package the module is in.  The parent is derived from the name.

    `is_package` determines if the module is considered a package or
    not.  On modules this is reflected by the `__path__` attribute.

    `origin` is the specific location used by the loader from which to
    load the module, if that information is available.  When filename is
    set, origin will match.

    `has_location` indicates that a spec's "origin" reflects a location.
    When this is True, `__file__` attribute of the module is set.

    `cached` is the location of the cached bytecode file, if any.  It
    corresponds to the `__cached__` attribute.

    `submodule_search_locations` is the sequence of path entries to
    search when importing submodules.  If set, is_package should be
    True--and False otherwise.

    Packages are simply modules that (may) have submodules.  If a spec
    has a non-None value in `submodule_search_locations`, the import
    system will consider modules loaded from the spec as packages.

    Only finders (see importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder and
    importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder) should modify ModuleSpec instances.

    An RFC 2047/2243 encoded word has the form:

        =?charset*lang?cte?encoded_string?=

    where '*lang' may be omitted but the other parts may not be.

    This function expects exactly such a string (that is, it does not check the
    syntax and may raise errors if the string is not well formed), and returns
    the encoded_string decoded first from its Content Transfer Encoding and
    then from the resulting bytes into unicode using the specified charset.  If
    the cte-decoded string does not successfully decode using the specified
    character set, a defect is added to the defects list and the unknown octets
    are replaced by the unicode 'unknown' character \uFDFF.

    The specified charset and language are returned.  The default for language,
    which is rarely if ever encountered, is the empty string.

    Produces an RFC 2047/2243 encoded word of the form:

        =?charset*lang?cte?encoded_string?=

    where '*lang' is omitted unless the 'lang' parameter is given a value.
    Optional argument charset (defaults to utf-8) specifies the charset to use
    to encode the string to binary before CTE encoding it.  Optional argument
    'encoding' is the cte specifier for the encoding that should be used ('q'
    or 'b'); if it is None (the default) the encoding which produces the
    shortest encoded sequence is used, except that 'q' is preferred if it is up
    to five characters longer.  Optional argument 'lang' (default '') gives the
    RFC 2243 language string to specify in the encoded word.

''Policy''Compat32''compat32''Policy Object basic framework.

    This class is useless unless subclassed.  A subclass should define
    class attributes with defaults for any values that are to be
    managed by the Policy object.  The constructor will then allow
    non-default values to be set for these attributes at instance
    creation time.  The instance will be callable, taking these same
    attributes keyword arguments, and returning a new instance
    identical to the called instance except for those values changed
    by the keyword arguments.  Instances may be added, yielding new
    instances with any non-default values from the right hand
    operand overriding those in the left hand operand.  That is,

        A + B == A(<non-default values of B>)

    The repr of an instance can be used to reconstruct the object
    if and only if the repr of the values can be used to reconstruct
    those values.

        See class docstring for a list of overridable attributes.

        ''{!r} is an invalid keyword argument for {}''{}={!r}''Return a new instance with specified attributes changed.

        The new instance has the same attribute values as the current object,
        except for the changes passed in as keyword arguments.

        ''{!r} object attribute {!r} is read-only''{!r} object has no attribute {!r}''Non-default values from right operand override those from left.

        The object returned is a new instance of the subclass.

        ''Controls for how messages are interpreted and formatted.

    Most of the classes and many of the methods in the email package accept
    Policy objects as parameters.  A Policy object contains a set of values and
    functions that control how input is interpreted and how output is rendered.
    For example, the parameter 'raise_on_defect' controls whether or not an RFC
    violation results in an error being raised or not, while 'max_line_length'
    controls the maximum length of output lines when a Message is serialized.

    Any valid attribute may be overridden when a Policy is created by passing
    it as a keyword argument to the constructor.  Policy objects are immutable,
    but a new Policy object can be created with only certain values changed by
    calling the Policy instance with keyword arguments.  Policy objects can
    also be added, producing a new Policy object in which the non-default
    attributes set in the right hand operand overwrite those specified in the
    left operand.

    Settable attributes:

    raise_on_defect     -- If true, then defects should be raised as errors.
                           Default: False.

    linesep             -- string containing the value to use as separation
                           between output lines.  Default '\n'.

    cte_type            -- Type of allowed content transfer encodings

                           7bit  -- ASCII only

                           Default: 8bit.  Also controls the disposition of
                           (RFC invalid) binary data in headers; see the
                           documentation of the binary_fold method.

    max_line_length     -- maximum length of lines, excluding 'linesep',
                           during serialization.  None or 0 means no line

                           part of another header.
                           This is a check against custom Header & fold()

    ''r"""''linesep''8bit''Based on policy, either raise defect or call register_defect.

            handle_defect(obj, defect)

        defect should be a Defect subclass, but in any case must be an
        Exception subclass.  obj is the object on which the defect should be
        registered if it is not raised.  If the raise_on_defect is True, the
        defect is raised as an error, otherwise the object and the defect are
        passed to register_defect.

        This method is intended to be called by parsers that discover defects.
        The email package parsers always call it with Defect instances.

        ''Record 'defect' on 'obj'.

        Called by handle_defect if raise_on_defect is False.  This method is
        part of the Policy API so that Policy subclasses can implement custom
        defect handling.  The default implementation calls the append method of
        the defects attribute of obj.  The objects used by the email package by
        default that get passed to this method will always have a defects
        attribute with an append method.

        ''Return the maximum allowed number of headers named 'name'.

        Called when a header is added to a Message object.  If the returned
        value is not 0 or None, and there are already a number of headers with
        the name 'name' equal to the value returned, a ValueError is raised.

        Because the default behavior of Message's __setitem__ is to append the
        value to the list of headers, it is easy to create duplicate headers
        without realizing it.  This method allows certain headers to be limited
        in the number of instances of that header that may be added to a
        Message programmatically.  (The limit is not observed by the parser,
        which will faithfully produce as many headers as exist in the message
        being parsed.)

        The default implementation returns None for all header names.
        ''Given a list of linesep terminated strings constituting the lines of

This is an implementation of decimal floating point arithmetic based on
the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification:

    http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html

and IEEE standard 854-1987:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_854-1987

Decimal floating point has finite precision with arbitrarily large bounds.

The purpose of this module is to support arithmetic using familiar
"schoolhouse" rules and to avoid some of the tricky representation
issues associated with binary floating point.  The package is especially
useful for financial applications or for contexts where users have
expectations that are at odds with binary floating point (for instance,
in binary floating point, 1.00 % 0.1 gives 0.09999999999999995 instead
of 0.0; Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('0.1') returns the expected
Decimal('0.00')).

Here are some examples of using the decimal module:

''1.70''2.4.2''numbers''sign digits exponent''Base exception class.

    Used exceptions derive from this.
    If an exception derives from another exception besides this (such as
    Underflow (Inexact, Rounded, Subnormal) that indicates that it is only
    called if the others are present.  This isn't actually used for
    anything, though.

    handle  -- Called when context._raise_error is called and the
               trap_enabler is not set.  First argument is self, second is the
               context.  More arguments can be given, those being after
               the explanation in _raise_error (For example,
               context._raise_error(NewError, '(-x)!', self._sign) would
               call NewError().handle(context, self._sign).)

    To define a new exception, it should be sufficient to have it derive
    from DecimalException.
    ''Exponent of a 0 changed to fit bounds.

    This occurs and signals clamped if the exponent of a result has been
    altered in order to fit the constraints of a specific concrete
    representation.  This may occur when the exponent of a zero result would
    be outside the bounds of a representation, or when a large normal
    number would have an encoded exponent that cannot be represented.  In
    this latter case, the exponent is reduced to fit and the corresponding
    number of zero digits are appended to the coefficient ("fold-down").
    ''An invalid operation was performed.

    Various bad things cause this:

    Something creates a signaling NaN
    -INF + INF
    0 * (+-)INF
    (+-)INF / (+-)INF
    x % 0
    (+-)INF % x
    x._rescale( non-integer )
    sqrt(-x) , x > 0
    0 ** 0
    x ** (non-integer)
    x ** (+-)INF
    An operand is invalid

    The result of the operation after these is a quiet positive NaN,
    except when the cause is a signaling NaN, in which case the result is
    also a quiet NaN, but with the original sign, and an optional
    diagnostic information.
    ''_sign''_int''Trying to convert badly formed string.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if a string is being
    converted to a number and it does not conform to the numeric string
    syntax.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    ''Division by 0.

    This occurs and signals division-by-zero if division of a finite number
    by zero was attempted (during a divide-integer or divide operation, or a
    power operation with negative right-hand operand), and the dividend was
    not zero.

    The result of the operation is [sign,inf], where sign is the exclusive
    or of the signs of the operands for divide, or is 1 for an odd power of
    -0, for power.
    ''Cannot perform the division adequately.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if the integer result of a
    divide-integer or remainder operation had too many digits (would be
    longer than precision).  The result is [0,qNaN].
    ''Undefined result of division.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if division by zero was
    attempted (during a divide-integer, divide, or remainder operation), and
    the dividend is also zero.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    ''Had to round, losing information.

    This occurs and signals inexact whenever the result of an operation is
    not exact (that is, it needed to be rounded and any discarded digits
    were non-zero), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The inexact signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.
    ''Invalid context.  Unknown rounding, for example.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if an invalid context was
    detected during an operation.  This can occur if contexts are not checked
    on creation and either the precision exceeds the capability of the
    underlying concrete representation or an unknown or unsupported rounding
    was specified.  These aspects of the context need only be checked when
    the values are required to be used.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    ''Number got rounded (not  necessarily changed during rounding).

    This occurs and signals rounded whenever the result of an operation is
    rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the
    coefficient), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The rounded signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
    ''Exponent < Emin before rounding.

    This occurs and signals subnormal whenever the result of a conversion or
    operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less than
    Emin, before any rounding).  The result in all cases is unchanged.

    The subnormal signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
    ''Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide
    by zero), after rounding, would be greater than the largest value that
    can be handled by the implementation (the value Emax).

    The result depends on the rounding mode:

    For round-half-up and round-half-even (and for round-half-down and
    round-up, if implemented), the result of the operation is [sign,inf],
    where sign is the sign of the intermediate result.  For round-down, the
    result is the largest finite number that can be represented in the
    current precision, with the sign of the intermediate result.  For
    round-ceiling, the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of
    the intermediate result is 1, or is [0,inf] otherwise.  For round-floor,
    the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of the intermediate
    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.
    ''Numerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the
    adjusted exponent of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
    the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
    Emin).  That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.

    The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
    necessary, so that its exponent is not less than Etiny.  This may result
    in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of Etiny.

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
    ''Enable stricter semantics for mixing floats and Decimals.

    If the signal is not trapped (default), mixing floats and Decimals is
    permitted in the Decimal() constructor, context.create_decimal() and
    all comparison operators. Both conversion and comparisons are exact.
    Any occurrence of a mixed operation is silently recorded by setting
    FloatOperation in the context flags.  Explicit conversions with
    Decimal.from_float() or context.create_decimal_from_float() do not
    set the flag.

    Otherwise (the signal is trapped), only equality comparisons and explicit
    conversions are silent. All other mixed operations raise FloatOperation.

    a new context and sets this thread's context.

        With two arguments, compute a**b.  If a is negative then b
        must be integral.  The result will be inexact unless b is
        integral and the result is finite and can be expressed exactly
        in 'precision' digits.

        With three arguments, compute (a**b) % modulo.  For the
        three argument form, the following restrictions on the
        arguments hold:

         - all three arguments must be integral
         - b must be nonnegative
         - at least one of a or b must be nonzero
         - modulo must be nonzero and have at most 'precision' digits

        The result of pow(a, b, modulo) is identical to the result
        that would be obtained by computing (a**b) % modulo with
        unbounded precision, but is computed more efficiently.  It is

''DOTALL''Parse and validate a format specifier.

    Turns a standard numeric format specifier into a dict, with the
    following entries:

      fill: fill character to pad field to minimum width
      align: alignment type, either '<', '>', '=' or '^'
      sign: either '+', '-' or ' '
      minimumwidth: nonnegative integer giving minimum width
      zeropad: boolean, indicating whether to pad with zeros
      thousands_sep: string to use as thousands separator, or ''
      grouping: grouping for thousands separators, in format
        used by localeconv
      decimal_point: string to use for decimal point
      precision: nonnegative integer giving precision, or None
      type: one of the characters 'eEfFgG%', or None

    ''=''^''Unrecognised alignment field''Convert a localeconv-style grouping into a (possibly infinite)
    iterable of integers representing group lengths.

    ''unrecognised format for grouping''Insert thousands separators into a digit string.

    spec is a dictionary whose keys should include 'thousands_sep' and
    'grouping'; typically it's the result of parsing the format
    specifier using _parse_format_specifier.

    The min_width keyword argument gives the minimum length of the
    result, which will be padded on the left with zeros if necessary.

    If necessary, the zero padding adds an extra '0' on the left to
    avoid a leading thousands separator.  For example, inserting
    commas every three digits in '123456', with min_width=8, gives
    '0,123,456', even though that has length 9.

(Note that this module provides a Python version of the threading.local
 class.  Depending on the version of Python you're using, there may be a
 faster one available.  You should always import the `local` class from
 `threading`.)

Thread-local objects support the management of thread-local data.
If you have data that you want to be local to a thread, simply create
a thread-local object and use its attributes:

  >>> mydata = local()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.number
  42

You can also access the local-object's dictionary:

  >>> mydata.__dict__
  {'number': 42}
  >>> mydata.__dict__.setdefault('widgets', [])
  []
  >>> mydata.widgets
  []

What's important about thread-local objects is that their data are
local to a thread. If we access the data in a different thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> def f():
  ...     items = sorted(mydata.__dict__.items())
  ...     log.append(items)
  ...     mydata.number = 11
  ...     log.append(mydata.number)

  >>> import threading
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[], 11]

we get different data.  Furthermore, changes made in the other thread
don't affect data seen in this thread:

  >>> mydata.number
  42

Of course, values you get from a local object, including a __dict__
attribute, are for whatever thread was current at the time the
attribute was read.  For that reason, you generally don't want to save
these values across threads, as they apply only to the thread they
came from.

You can create custom local objects by subclassing the local class:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     number = 2
  ...     def __init__(self, /, **kw):
  ...         self.__dict__.update(kw)
  ...     def squared(self):
  ...         return self.number ** 2

This can be useful to support default values, methods and
initialization.  Note that if you define an __init__ method, it will be
called each time the local object is used in a separate thread.  This
is necessary to initialize each thread's dictionary.

Now if we create a local object:

  >>> mydata = MyLocal(color='red')

Now we have a default number:

  >>> mydata.number
  2

an initial color:

  >>> mydata.color
  'red'
  >>> del mydata.color

And a method that operates on the data:

  >>> mydata.squared()
  4

As before, we can access the data in a separate thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[('color', 'red')], 11]

without affecting this thread's data:

  >>> mydata.number
  2
  >>> mydata.color
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'MyLocal' object has no attribute 'color'

Note that subclasses can define slots, but they are not thread
local. They are shared across threads:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     __slots__ = 'number'

  >>> mydata = MyLocal()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.color = 'red'

So, the separate thread:

  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()

affects what we see:

  >>> mydata.number
  11

>>> del mydata

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

All other classes in this module are considered implementation details.
(Also note that HelpFormatter and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter are only
considered public as object names -- the API of the formatter objects is
still considered an implementation detail.)

    Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
    needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
    command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also
    all attributes of Action instances.

    Keyword Arguments:

        - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which
            should be associated with this action.

        - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)

        - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be
            consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single
            value will be produced.  Other values include:
                - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
                - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
                - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
                - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that
            with the default, a single value will be produced, while with
            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

        - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the
            help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.

            same values as the builtin open() function.
        - bufsize -- The file's desired buffer size. Accepts the same values as

    ast
    ~~~

    The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python
    abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change with
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what
    the current grammar looks like and allows modifications of it.

    An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing `ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST` as
    a flag to the `compile()` builtin function or by using the `parse()`
    function from this module.  The result will be a tree of objects whose
    classes all inherit from `ast.AST`.

    A modified abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object
    using the built-in `compile()` function.

    Additionally various helper functions are provided that make working with
    the trees simpler.  The main intention of the helper functions and this
    module in general is to provide an easy to use interface for libraries
    that work tightly with the python syntax (template engines for example).

    ''
    Evaluate an expression node or a string containing only a Python
    expression.  The string or node provided may only consist of the following
    Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts,
    sets, booleans, and None.

    Caution: A complex expression can overflow the C stack and cause a crash.
    ''node''malformed node or string'' on line ''left''right''
    Return a formatted dump of the tree in node.  This is mainly useful for
    debugging purposes.  If annotate_fields is true (by default),
    the returned string will show the names and the values for fields.
    If annotate_fields is false, the result string will be more compact by
    omitting unambiguous field names.  Attributes such as line
    numbers and column offsets are not dumped by default.  If this is wanted,
    include_attributes can be set to true.  If indent is a non-negative
    integer or string, then the tree will be pretty-printed with that indent
    level. None (the default) selects the single line representation.

    Copy source location (`lineno`, `col_offset`, `end_lineno`, and `end_col_offset`
    attributes) from *old_node* to *new_node* if possible, and return *new_node*.
    ''col_offset''end_''
    When you compile a node tree with compile(), the compiler expects lineno and
    col_offset attributes for every node that supports them.  This is rather
    tedious to fill in for generated nodes, so this helper adds these attributes
    recursively where not already set, by setting them to the values of the
    parent node.  It works recursively starting at *node*.
    ''
    Increment the line number and end line number of each node in the tree
    starting at *node* by *n*. This is useful to "move code" to a different
    location in a file.
    ''walk''
    Yield a tuple of ``(fieldname, value)`` for each field in ``node._fields``
    that is present on *node*.
    ''
    Yield all direct child nodes of *node*, that is, all fields that are nodes
    and all items of fields that are lists of nodes.
    ''
    Return the docstring for the given node or None if no docstring can
    be found.  If the node provided does not have docstrings a TypeError
    will be raised.

    If *clean* is `True`, all tabs are expanded to spaces and any whitespace
    that can be uniformly removed from the second line onwards is removed.
    ''%r can't have docstrings''Str''Split a string into lines ignoring form feed and other chars.

    This mimics how the Python parser splits source code.
    ''Replace all chars except '\f\t' in a line with spaces.''	''Get source code segment of the *source* that generated *node*.

    If some location information (`lineno`, `end_lineno`, `col_offset`,
    or `end_col_offset`) is missing, return None.

    If *padded* is `True`, the first line of a multi-line statement will
    be padded with spaces to match its original position.
    ''
    Recursively yield all descendant nodes in the tree starting at *node*
    (including *node* itself), in no specified order.  This is useful if you
    only want to modify nodes in place and don't care about the context.
    ''
    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
    visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.

    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
    methods.

    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are ``'visit_'`` +
    class name of the node.  So a `TryFinally` node visit function would
    be `visit_TryFinally`.  This behavior can be changed by overriding
    the `visit` method.  If no visitor function exists for a node
    (return value `None`) the `generic_visit` visitor is used instead.

    Don't use the `NodeVisitor` if you want to apply changes to nodes during
    traversing.  For this a special visitor exists (`NodeTransformer`) that
    allows modifications.
    ''Visit a node.''visit_''Called if no explicit visitor function exists for a node.'' is deprecated; add visit_Constant''
    A :class:`NodeVisitor` subclass that walks the abstract syntax tree and
    allows modification of nodes.

    The `NodeTransformer` will walk the AST and use the return value of the
    visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value of
    the visitor method is ``None``, the node will be removed from its location,
    otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value may be the
    original node in which case no replacement takes place.

    Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups
    (``foo``) to ``data['foo']``::

       class RewriteName(NodeTransformer):

           def visit_Name(self, node):
               return Subscript(
                   value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load()),
                   slice=Constant(value=node.id),
                   ctx=node.ctx
               )

    Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must
    either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth:`generic_visit`
    method for the node first.

    For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all
    statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than
    just a single node.

    Usually you use the transformer like this::

       node = YourTransformer().visit(node)

This module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045
to encode arbitrary 8-bit data using the three 8-bit bytes in four 7-bit
characters encoding known as Base64.

It is used in the MIME standards for email to attach images, audio, and text
using some 8-bit character sets to messages.

This module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies
with Base64 encoding.

RFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an
`encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names
in To:, From:, Cc:, etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.

This module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character conversion
necessary for proper internationalized headers; it only does dumb encoding and
decoding.  To deal with the various line wrapping issues, use the email.header
module.
''body_decode''body_encode''decodestring''header_encode''header_length''Return the length of s when it is encoded with base64.''iso-8859-1''Encode a single header line with Base64 encoding in a given charset.

    charset names the character set to use to encode the header.  It defaults
    to iso-8859-1.  Base64 encoding is defined in RFC 2045.
    ''=?%s?b?%s?=''Encode a string with base64.

    Each line will be wrapped at, at most, maxlinelen characters (defaults to
    76 characters).

    Each line of encoded text will end with eol, which defaults to "\n".  Set
    this to "\r\n" if you will be using the result of this function directly
    in an email.
    ''Decode a raw base64 string, returning a bytes object.

    This function does not parse a full MIME header value encoded with
    base64 (like =?iso-8859-1?b?bmloISBuaWgh?=) -- please use the high
    level email.header class for that functionality.
    ''raw-unicode-escape''Base implementation of event loop.

The event loop can be broken up into a multiplexer (the part
responsible for notifying us of I/O events) and the event loop proper,
which wraps a multiplexer with functionality for scheduling callbacks,
immediately or at a given time in the future.

Whenever a public API takes a callback, subsequent positional
arguments will be passed to the callback if/when it is called.  This
avoids the proliferation of trivial lambdas implementing closures.
Keyword arguments for the callback are not supported; this is a
conscious design decision, leaving the door open for keyword arguments
to modify the meaning of the API call itself.

    This class takes care of details of the trace facility;
    a derived class should implement user interaction.
    The standard debugger class (pdb.Pdb) is an example.

    The optional skip argument must be an iterable of glob-style
    module name patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames
    that originate in a module that matches one of these patterns.
    Whether a frame is considered to originate in a certain module

        ''Set values of attributes as ready to start debugging.''Dispatch a trace function for debugged frames based on the event.

        This function is installed as the trace function for debugged
        frames. Its return value is the new trace function, which is
        usually itself. The default implementation decides how to
        dispatch a frame, depending on the type of event (passed in as a
        string) that is about to be executed.

        The event can be one of the following:
            line: A new line of code is going to be executed.
            call: A function is about to be called or another code block
                  is entered.
            return: A function or other code block is about to return.
            exception: An exception has occurred.
            c_call: A C function is about to be called.
            c_return: A C function has returned.
            c_exception: A C function has raised an exception.

        For the Python events, specialized functions (see the dispatch_*()
        methods) are called.  For the C events, no action is taken.

        The arg parameter depends on the previous event.

This module provides a file interface, classes for incremental
(de)compression, and functions for one-shot (de)compression.
''BZ2File''Nadeem Vawda <nadeem.vawda@gmail.com>''A file object providing transparent bzip2 (de)compression.

    A BZ2File can act as a wrapper for an existing file object, or refer
    directly to a named file on disk.

    Note that BZ2File provides a *binary* file interface - data read is
    returned as bytes, and data to be written should be given as bytes.
    ''Open a bzip2-compressed file.

        If filename is a str, bytes, or PathLike object, it gives the
        name of the file to be opened. Otherwise, it should be a file
        object, which will be used to read or write the compressed data.

        mode can be 'r' for reading (default), 'w' for (over)writing,
        'x' for creating exclusively, or 'a' for appending. These can
        equivalently be given as 'rb', 'wb', 'xb', and 'ab'.

        If mode is 'w', 'x' or 'a', compresslevel can be a number between 1
        and 9 specifying the level of compression: 1 produces the least
        compression, and 9 (default) produces the most compression.

        If mode is 'r', the input file may be the concatenation of
        multiple compressed streams.
        ''compresslevel must be between 1 and 9''xb''ab''Invalid mode: %r''filename must be a str, bytes, file or PathLike object''Flush and close the file.

        May be called more than once without error. Once the file is
        closed, any other operation on it will raise a ValueError.
        ''True if this file is closed.''Return the file descriptor for the underlying file.''Return whether the file supports seeking.''Return whether the file was opened for reading.''Return whether the file was opened for writing.''Return buffered data without advancing the file position.

        Always returns at least one byte of data, unless at EOF.
        The exact number of bytes returned is unspecified.
        ''Read up to size uncompressed bytes from the file.

        If size is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
        Returns b'' if the file is already at EOF.
        ''Read up to size uncompressed bytes, while trying to avoid
        making multiple reads from the underlying stream. Reads up to a
        buffer's worth of data if size is negative.

        Returns b'' if the file is at EOF.
        ''Read bytes into b.

        Returns the number of bytes read (0 for EOF).
        ''Read a line of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        The terminating newline (if present) is retained. If size is
        non-negative, no more than size bytes will be read (in which
        case the line may be incomplete). Returns b'' if already at EOF.
        ''Integer argument expected''Read a list of lines of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        size can be specified to control the number of lines read: no
        further lines will be read once the total size of the lines read
        so far equals or exceeds size.
        ''Write a byte string to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, which is
        always the length of data in bytes. Note that due to buffering,
        the file on disk may not reflect the data written until close()
        is called.
        ''Write a sequence of byte strings to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written.
        seq can be any iterable yielding byte strings.

        Line separators are not added between the written byte strings.
        ''Change the file position.

        The new position is specified by offset, relative to the
        position indicated by whence. Values for whence are:

            0: start of stream (default); offset must not be negative
            1: current stream position
            2: end of stream; offset must not be positive

        Returns the new file position.

        Note that seeking is emulated, so depending on the parameters,
        this operation may be extremely slow.
        ''Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode.

    The filename argument can be an actual filename (a str, bytes, or
    PathLike object), or an existing file object to read from or write
    to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb", "w", "wb", "x", "xb", "a" or
    "ab" for binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt" or "at" for text mode.
    The default mode is "rb", and the default compresslevel is 9.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the BZ2File
    constructor: BZ2File(filename, mode, compresslevel). In this case,
    the encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, a BZ2File object is created, and wrapped in an
    io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
    handling behavior, and line ending(s).

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.

    When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
    * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
        the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
        exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
    * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
        objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
        to any explicit message passed.
    * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
        by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
        attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.
    ''_classSetupFailed''Create an instance of the class that will use the named test
           method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does
           not have a method with the specified name.

        This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register

            typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
                    are of the same type in assertEqual().

           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
           raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
           deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
           unexpected exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
           the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
           exception after the assertion::

               with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_exception = cm.exception

        ''assertWarns''Fail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
           triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
           warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
           out, or raised as an exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
           warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
           and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
           of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
           This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::

               with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_warning = cm.warning
               self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
        ''Fail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted

        a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
        At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
        be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
        `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
        objects.

        Example::

            with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:

        ''distutils.ccompiler

Contains CCompiler, an abstract base class that defines the interface
for the Distutils compiler abstraction model.''Abstract base class to define the interface that must be implemented
    by real compiler classes.  Also has some utility methods used by
    several compiler classes.

    The basic idea behind a compiler abstraction class is that each
    instance can be used for all the compile/link steps in building a
    single project.  Thus, attributes common to all of those compile and
    link steps -- include directories, macros to define, libraries to link
    against, etc. -- are attributes of the compiler instance.  To allow for
    variability in how individual files are treated, most of those
    attributes may be varied on a per-compilation or per-link basis.
    ''.c''c++''.cc''.cpp''.cxx''objc''.m''set_executable''Define the executables (and options for them) that will be run
        to perform the various stages of compilation.  The exact set of
        executables that may be specified here depends on the compiler
        class (via the 'executables' class attribute), but most will have:
          compiler      the C/C++ compiler
          linker_so     linker used to create shared objects and libraries
          linker_exe    linker used to create binary executables
          archiver      static library creator

        On platforms with a command-line (Unix, DOS/Windows), each of these
        is a string that will be split into executable name and (optional)
        list of arguments.  (Splitting the string is done similarly to how
        Unix shells operate: words are delimited by spaces, but quotes and
        backslashes can override this.  See
        'distutils.util.split_quoted()'.)
        ''unknown executable '%s' for class %s''Ensures that every element of 'definitions' is a valid macro

        ''invalid macro definition '%s': ''must be tuple (string,), (string, string), or ''(string, None)''Define a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by this
        compiler object.  The optional parameter 'value' should be a
        string; if it is not supplied, then the macro will be defined
        without an explicit value and the exact outcome depends on the
        compiler used (XXX true? does ANSI say anything about this?)
        ''Undefine a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by
        this compiler object.  If the same macro is defined by
        'define_macro()' and undefined by 'undefine_macro()' the last call
        takes precedence (including multiple redefinitions or
        undefinitions).  If the macro is redefined/undefined on a
        per-compilation basis (ie. in the call to 'compile()'), then that
        takes precedence.
        ''Add 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for

        to the list passed to 'set_include_dirs()'.  This does not affect

        name of the library itself: the actual filename will be inferred by
        the linker, the compiler, or the compiler class (depending on the
        platform).

        The linker will be instructed to link against libraries in the
        order they were supplied to 'add_library()' and/or

        ''Compile one or more source files.

        'sources' must be a list of filenames, most likely C/C++

        handle resource files in 'sources').  Return a list of object
        filenames, one per source filename in 'sources'.  Depending on
        the implementation, not all source files will necessarily be

        returned.

        If 'output_dir' is given, object files will be put under it, while
        retaining their original path component.  That is, "foo/bar.c"
        normally compiles to "foo/bar.o" (for a Unix implementation); if
        'output_dir' is "build", then it would compile to
        "build/foo/bar.o".

        'macros', if given, must be a list of macro definitions.  A macro
        definition is either a (name, value) 2-tuple or a (name,) 1-tuple.
        The former defines a macro; if the value is None, the macro is
        defined without an explicit value.  The 1-tuple case undefines a
        macro.  Later definitions/redefinitions/ undefinitions take
        precedence.

        'include_dirs', if given, must be a list of strings, the
        directories to add to the default include file search path for this
        compilation only.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, the compiler will be instructed to
        output debug symbols in (or alongside) the object file(s).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are implementation- dependent.
        On platforms that have the notion of a command-line (e.g. Unix,
        DOS/Windows), they are most likely lists of strings: extra
        command-line arguments to prepend/append to the compiler command
        line.  On other platforms, consult the implementation class
        documentation.  In any event, they are intended as an escape hatch
        for those occasions when the abstract compiler framework doesn't
        cut the mustard.

        'depends', if given, is a list of filenames that all targets
        depend on.  If a source file is older than any file in
        depends, then the source file will be recompiled.  This
        supports dependency tracking, but only at a coarse
        granularity.

        Raises CompileError on failure.
        ''Compile 'src' to product 'obj'.''Link a bunch of stuff together to create a static library file.
        The "bunch of stuff" consists of the list of object files supplied

        'add_link_object()' and/or 'set_link_objects()', the libraries
        supplied to 'add_library()' and/or 'set_libraries()', and the
        libraries supplied as 'libraries' (if any).

        'output_libname' should be a library name, not a filename; the
        filename will be inferred from the library name.  'output_dir' is
        the directory where the library file will be put.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, debugging information will be
        included in the library (note that on most platforms, it is the
        compile step where this matters: the 'debug' flag is included here
        just for consistency).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of
        certain languages.

        Raises LibError on failure.
        ''shared_object''shared_library''Link a bunch of stuff together to create an executable or
        shared library file.

        The "bunch of stuff" consists of the list of object files supplied
        as 'objects'.  'output_filename' should be a filename.  If
        'output_dir' is supplied, 'output_filename' is relative to it
        (i.e. 'output_filename' can provide directory components if
        needed).

        'libraries' is a list of libraries to link against.  These are
        library names, not filenames, since they're translated into
        filenames in a platform-specific way (eg. "foo" becomes "libfoo.a"
        on Unix and "foo.lib" on DOS/Windows).  However, they can include a
        directory component, which means the linker will look in that
        specific directory rather than searching all the normal locations.

        'library_dirs', if supplied, should be a list of directories to
        search for libraries that were specified as bare library names
        (ie. no directory component).  These are on top of the system
        default and those supplied to 'add_library_dir()' and/or
        'set_library_dirs()'.  'runtime_library_dirs' is a list of
        directories that will be embedded into the shared library and used
        to search for other shared libraries that *it* depends on at
        run-time.  (This may only be relevant on Unix.)

        'export_symbols' is a list of symbols that the shared library will
        export.  (This appears to be relevant only on Windows.)

        'debug' is as for 'compile()' and 'create_static_lib()', with the
        slight distinction that it actually matters on most platforms (as
        opposed to 'create_static_lib()', which includes a 'debug' flag
        mostly for form's sake).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are as for 'compile()' (except
        of course that they supply command-line arguments for the
        particular linker being used).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of

    charset is the input character set, and must be the canonical name of a
    character set.

    Optional header_enc and body_enc is either charset.QP for
    quoted-printable, charset.BASE64 for base64 encoding, charset.SHORTEST for
    the shortest of qp or base64 encoding, or None for no encoding.  SHORTEST
    is only valid for header_enc.  It describes how message headers and
    message bodies in the input charset are to be encoded.  Default is no
    encoding.

    Optional output_charset is the character set that the output should be
    in.  Conversions will proceed from input charset, to Unicode, to the
    output charset when the method Charset.convert() is called.  The default
    is to output in the same character set as the input.

    Both input_charset and output_charset must have Unicode codec entries in
    the module's charset-to-codec mapping; use add_codec(charset, codecname)
    to add codecs the module does not know about.  See the codecs module's
    documentation for more information.
    ''SHORTEST not allowed for body_enc''Add a character set alias.

    alias is the alias name, e.g. latin-1
    canonical is the character set's canonical name, e.g. iso-8859-1
    ''Add a codec that map characters in the given charset to/from Unicode.

    charset is the canonical name of a character set.  codecname is the name
    of a Python codec, as appropriate for the second argument to the unicode()
    built-in, or to the encode() method of a Unicode string.
    ''Map character sets to their email properties.

    This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email
    for a specific character set.  It also provides convenience routines for
    converting between character sets, given the availability of the
    applicable codecs.  Given a character set, it will do its best to provide
    information on how to use that character set in an email in an
    RFC-compliant way.

    Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or base64
    when used in email headers or bodies.  Certain character sets must be
    converted outright, and are not allowed in email.  Instances of this
    module expose the following information about a character set:

    input_charset: The initial character set specified.  Common aliases
                   are converted to their `official' email names (e.g. latin_1
                   is converted to iso-8859-1).  Defaults to 7-bit us-ascii.

    header_encoding: If the character set must be encoded before it can be
                     used in an email header, this attribute will be set to
                     charset.QP (for quoted-printable), charset.BASE64 (for
                     base64 encoding), or charset.SHORTEST for the shortest of
                     QP or BASE64 encoding.  Otherwise, it will be None.

    body_encoding: Same as header_encoding, but describes the encoding for the
                   mail message's body, which indeed may be different than the
                   header encoding.  charset.SHORTEST is not allowed for
                   body_encoding.

    output_charset: Some character sets must be converted before they can be
                    used in email headers or bodies.  If the input_charset is
                    one of them, this attribute will contain the name of the
                    charset output will be converted to.  Otherwise, it will
                    be None.

    input_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert the
                 input_charset to Unicode.  If no conversion codec is
                 necessary, this attribute will be None.

    output_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode
                  to the output_charset.  If no conversion codec is necessary,
                  this attribute will have the same value as the input_codec.
    ''Return the content-transfer-encoding used for body encoding.

        This is either the string `quoted-printable' or `base64' depending on
        the encoding used, or it is a function in which case you should call
        the function with a single argument, the Message object being
        encoded.  The function should then set the Content-Transfer-Encoding
        header itself to whatever is appropriate.

        Returns "quoted-printable" if self.body_encoding is QP.
        Returns "base64" if self.body_encoding is BASE64.
        Returns conversion function otherwise.
        ''quoted-printable''Return the output character set.

        This is self.output_charset if that is not None, otherwise it is
        self.input_charset.
        ''Header-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        :param maxlengths: Maximum line length iterator.  Each element
            returned from this iterator will provide the next maximum line
            length.  This parameter is used as an argument to built-in next()
            and should never be exhausted.  The maximum line lengths should
            not count the RFC 2047 chrome.  These line lengths are only a
            hint; the splitter does the best it can.
        :return: Lines of encoded strings, each with RFC 2047 chrome.
        ''Body-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on
        self.body_encoding.  If body_encoding is None, we assume the
        output charset is a 7bit encoding, so re-encoding the decoded
        string using the ascii codec produces the correct string version
        of the content.

HTTPConnection goes through a number of "states", which define when a client
may legally make another request or fetch the response for a particular
request. This diagram details these state transitions:

                            v
                          Request-sent

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

        any method if the body is a str or bytes-like object and not a file.
        ''Set up host and port for HTTP CONNECT tunnelling.

        In a connection that uses HTTP CONNECT tunneling, the host passed to the
        constructor is used as a proxy server that relays all communication to

        CONNECT request to the proxy server when the connection is established.

        This method must be called before the HTTP connection has been

Interpreters constructed with this class obey the following conventions:

1. End of file on input is processed as the command 'EOF'.
2. A command is parsed out of each line by collecting the prefix composed
   of characters in the identchars member.
3. A command `foo' is dispatched to a method 'do_foo()'; the do_ method
   is passed a single argument consisting of the remainder of the line.
4. Typing an empty line repeats the last command.  (Actually, it calls the
   method `emptyline', which may be overridden in a subclass.)
5. There is a predefined `help' method.  Given an argument `topic', it
   calls the command `help_topic'.  With no arguments, it lists all topics
   with defined help_ functions, broken into up to three topics; documented
   commands, miscellaneous help topics, and undocumented commands.
6. The command '?' is a synonym for `help'.  The command '!' is a synonym
   for `shell', if a do_shell method exists.
7. If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done automatically,
   and completing of commands args is done by calling complete_foo() with
   arguments text, line, begidx, endidx.  text is string we are matching
   against, all returned matches must begin with it.  line is the current
   input line (lstripped), begidx and endidx are the beginning and end
   indexes of the text being matched, which could be used to provide
   different completion depending upon which position the argument is in.

The `default' method may be overridden to intercept commands for which there
is no do_ method.

The `completedefault' method may be overridden to intercept completions for
commands that have no complete_ method.

The data member `self.ruler' sets the character used to draw separator lines
in the help messages.  If empty, no ruler line is drawn.  It defaults to "=".

If the value of `self.intro' is nonempty when the cmdloop method is called,
it is printed out on interpreter startup.  This value may be overridden
via an optional argument to the cmdloop() method.

The data members `self.doc_header', `self.misc_header', and
`self.undoc_header' set the headers used for the help function's
listings of documented functions, miscellaneous topics, and undocumented
functions respectively.
''Cmd''(Cmd) ''A simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.

    These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and
    prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.

    A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter
    framework.  There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather,
    it's useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself
    in order to inherit Cmd's methods and encapsulate action methods.

    ''Documented commands (type help <topic>):''Miscellaneous help topics:''Undocumented commands:''*** No help on %s''tab''Instantiate a line-oriented interpreter framework.

        The optional argument 'completekey' is the readline name of a
        completion key; it defaults to the Tab key. If completekey is
        not None and the readline module is available, command completion
        is done automatically. The optional arguments stdin and stdout
        specify alternate input and output file objects; if not specified,
        sys.stdin and sys.stdout are used.

        ''Repeatedly issue a prompt, accept input, parse an initial prefix

''CommandCompiler''compile_command''InteractiveInterpreter''InteractiveConsole''interact''Base class for InteractiveConsole.

    This class deals with parsing and interpreter state (the user's
    namespace); it doesn't deal with input buffering or prompting or
    input file naming (the filename is always passed in explicitly).

    ''Constructor.

        The optional 'locals' argument specifies the dictionary in
        which code will be executed; it defaults to a newly created
        dictionary with key "__name__" set to "__console__" and key
        "__doc__" set to None.

        ''__console__''<input>''Compile and run some source in the interpreter.

        Arguments are as for compile_command().

        One of several things can happen:

        1) The input is incorrect; compile_command() raised an
        exception (SyntaxError or OverflowError).  A syntax traceback
        will be printed by calling the showsyntaxerror() method.

        2) The input is incomplete, and more input is required;
        compile_command() returned None.  Nothing happens.

        3) The input is complete; compile_command() returned a code
        object.  The code is executed by calling self.runcode() (which
        also handles run-time exceptions, except for SystemExit).

        The return value is True in case 2, False in the other cases (unless
        an exception is raised).  The return value can be used to
        decide whether to use sys.ps1 or sys.ps2 to prompt the next
        line.

        ''Execute a code object.

        When an exception occurs, self.showtraceback() is called to
        display a traceback.  All exceptions are caught except
        SystemExit, which is reraised.

        A note about KeyboardInterrupt: this exception may occur
        elsewhere in this code, and may not always be caught.  The
        caller should be prepared to deal with it.

        ''Display the syntax error that just occurred.

        This doesn't display a stack trace because there isn't one.

        If a filename is given, it is stuffed in the exception instead
        of what was there before (because Python's parser always uses
        "<string>" when reading from a string).

        The output is written by self.write(), below.

        ''Display the exception that just occurred.

        We remove the first stack item because it is our own code.

        The output is written by self.write(), below.

        ''format_exception''Write a string.

        The base implementation writes to sys.stderr; a subclass may
        replace this with a different implementation.

        ''Closely emulate the behavior of the interactive Python interpreter.

    This class builds on InteractiveInterpreter and adds prompting
    using the familiar sys.ps1 and sys.ps2, and input buffering.

    ''<console>''Constructor.

        The optional locals argument will be passed to the
        InteractiveInterpreter base class.

        The optional filename argument should specify the (file)name
        of the input stream; it will show up in tracebacks.

        ''Reset the input buffer.''Closely emulate the interactive Python console.

        The optional banner argument specifies the banner to print
        before the first interaction; by default it prints a banner
        similar to the one printed by the real Python interpreter,
        followed by the current class name in parentheses (so as not
        to confuse this with the real interpreter -- since it's so
        close!).

        The optional exitmsg argument specifies the exit message
        printed when exiting. Pass the empty string to suppress
        printing an exit message. If exitmsg is not given or None,
        a default message is printed.

        ''>>> ''... ''Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.''Python %s on %s
%s
(%s)
''more''
KeyboardInterrupt
''now exiting %s...
''Push a line to the interpreter.

        The line should not have a trailing newline; it may have
        internal newlines.  The line is appended to a buffer and the
        interpreter's runsource() method is called with the
        concatenated contents of the buffer as source.  If this
        indicates that the command was executed or invalid, the buffer
        is reset; otherwise, the command is incomplete, and the buffer
        is left as it was after the line was appended.  The return
        value is 1 if more input is required, 0 if the line was dealt
        with in some way (this is the same as runsource()).

        ''Write a prompt and read a line.

        The returned line does not include the trailing newline.
        When the user enters the EOF key sequence, EOFError is raised.

        The base implementation uses the built-in function
        input(); a subclass may replace this with a different
        implementation.

        ''Closely emulate the interactive Python interpreter.

    This is a backwards compatible interface to the InteractiveConsole
    class.  When readfunc is not specified, it attempts to import the
    readline module to enable GNU readline if it is available.

    Arguments (all optional, all default to None):

    banner -- passed to InteractiveConsole.interact()
    readfunc -- if not None, replaces InteractiveConsole.raw_input()
    local -- passed to InteractiveInterpreter.__init__()
    exitmsg -- passed to InteractiveConsole.interact()

        '' Set the input stream's current position.

            Resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.
        '' Return the next decoded line from the input stream.'' StreamReaderWriter instances allow wrapping streams which
        work in both read and write modes.

        The design is such that one can use the factory functions
        returned by the codec.lookup() function to construct the
        instance.

    ''unknown'' Creates a StreamReaderWriter instance.

            stream must be a Stream-like object.

            Reader, Writer must be factory functions or classes
            providing the StreamReader, StreamWriter interface resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

        ''writer'' StreamRecoder instances translate data from one encoding to another.

        They use the complete set of APIs returned by the
        codecs.lookup() function to implement their task.

        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an
        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then
        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided
        Writer class.

        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using
        a Reader instance and then encoded and returned to the caller.

    '' Creates a StreamRecoder instance which implements a two-way
            conversion: encode and decode work on the frontend (the
            data visible to .read() and .write()) while Reader and Writer
            work on the backend (the data in stream).

            You can use these objects to do transparent
            transcodings from e.g. latin-1 to utf-8 and back.

            stream must be a file-like object.

            encode and decode must adhere to the Codec interface; Reader and
            Writer must be factory functions or classes providing the
            StreamReader and StreamWriter interfaces resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

        ''buffering'' Open an encoded file using the given mode and return
        a wrapped version providing transparent encoding/decoding.

        Note: The wrapped version will only accept the object format
        defined by the codecs, i.e. Unicode objects for most builtin
        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be
        Unicode as well.

        If encoding is not None, then the
        underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.
        The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.

        encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the
        file.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        buffering has the same meaning as for the builtin open() API.
        It defaults to -1 which means that the default buffer size will
        be used.

        The returned wrapped file object provides an extra attribute
        .encoding which allows querying the used encoding. This
        attribute is only available if an encoding was specified as
        parameter.

    '' Return a wrapped version of file which provides transparent
        encoding translation.

        Data written to the wrapped file is decoded according
        to the given data_encoding and then encoded to the underlying
        file using file_encoding. The intermediate data type
        will usually be Unicode but depends on the specified codecs.

        Bytes read from the file are decoded using file_encoding and then
        passed back to the caller encoded using data_encoding.

        If file_encoding is not given, it defaults to data_encoding.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        The returned wrapped file object provides two extra attributes
        .data_encoding and .file_encoding which reflect the given
        parameters of the same name. The attributes can be used for
        introspection by Python programs.

    ''sr'' Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its encoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

    '' Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its decoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

    '' Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its IncrementalEncoder class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found
        or the codecs doesn't provide an incremental encoder.

    '' Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its IncrementalDecoder class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found

    '' Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its StreamReader class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

    '' Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its StreamWriter class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

    ''
    Encoding iterator.

    Encodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalEncoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalEncoder
    constructor.
    ''
    Decoding iterator.

    Decodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalDecoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalDecoder
    constructor.
    '' make_identity_dict(rng) -> dict

        Return a dictionary where elements of the rng sequence are
        mapped to themselves.

    '' Creates an encoding map from a decoding map.

        If a target mapping in the decoding map occurs multiple
        times, then that target is mapped to None (undefined mapping),
        causing an exception when encountered by the charmap codec
        during translation.

        One example where this happens is cp875.py which decodes
        multiple character to \u001a.

    ''namereplace''Utilities to compile possibly incomplete Python source code.

This module provides two interfaces, broadly similar to the builtin
function compile(), which take program text, a filename and a 'mode'
and:

- Return code object if the command is complete and valid
- Return None if the command is incomplete
- Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
  syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
  malformed literals).

The two interfaces are:

compile_command(source, filename, symbol):

    Compiles a single command in the manner described above.

CommandCompiler():

    Instances of this class have __call__ methods identical in
    signature to compile_command; the difference is that if the
    instance compiles program text containing a __future__ statement,
    the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts
    with the statement in force.

The module also provides another class:

Compile():

    Instances of this class act like the built-in function compile,
    but with 'memory' in the sense described above.
''__future__''Compile''incomplete input''was never closed''Compile a command and determine whether it is incomplete.

    Arguments:

              or "eval"

    Return value / exceptions raised:

    - Return a code object if the command is complete and valid
    - Return None if the command is incomplete
    - Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
      syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
      malformed literals).
    ''Instances of this class behave much like the built-in compile

    ''Generic (shallow and deep) copying operations.

Interface summary:

        import copy

        x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
        x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For module specific errors, copy.Error is raised.

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for
compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or
class instances).

- A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the
  extent possible) inserts *the same objects* into it that the
  original contains.

- A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively,
  inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist
with shallow copy operations:

 a) recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly,
    contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop

 b) because deep copy copies *everything* it may copy too much, e.g.
    administrative data structures that should be shared even between
    copies

Python's deep copy operation avoids these problems by:

 a) keeping a table of objects already copied during the current
    copying pass

 b) letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the
    set of components copied

This version does not copy types like module, class, function, method,
nor stack trace, stack frame, nor file, socket, window, nor any
similar types.

Classes can use the same interfaces to control copying that they use
to control pickling: they can define methods called __getinitargs__(),
__getstate__() and __setstate__().  See the documentation for module
"pickle" for information on these methods.

    normally not be used unless someone tries to deepcopy
    the memo itself...

          y: int

      c = C(1, 2)

    dataclass instances. This will also look into built-in containers:
    tuples, lists, and dicts.

    The dataclass name will be 'cls_name'.  'fields' is an iterable

    the equivalent of calling 'field(name, type [, Field-info])'.

      C = make_dataclass('C', ['x', ('y', int), ('z', int, field(init=False))], bases=(Base,))

    is equivalent to:

      @dataclass
      class C(Base):
          x: 'typing.Any'
          y: int
          z: int = field(init=False)

    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to syncing up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.
    ''Construct a SequenceMatcher.

        Optional arg isjunk is None (the default), or a one-argument
        function that takes a sequence element and returns true iff the
        element is junk.  None is equivalent to passing "lambda x: 0", i.e.
        no elements are considered to be junk.  For example, pass
            lambda x: x in " \t"
        if you're comparing lines as sequences of characters, and don't
        want to synch up on blanks or hard tabs.

        Optional arg a is the first of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of a must be hashable.  See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq1().

        Optional arg b is the second of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of b must be hashable. See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq2().

        Optional arg autojunk should be set to False to disable the
        "automatic junk heuristic" that treats popular elements as junk
        (see module documentation for more information).
        ''Set the two sequences to be compared.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher()
        >>> s.set_seqs("abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        ''Set the first sequence to be compared.

        The second sequence to be compared is not changed.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.set_seq1("bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        1.0
        >>>

        ''Find longest matching block in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi].

        By default it will find the longest match in the entirety of a and b.

        If isjunk is not defined:

            k >= k'
            i <= i'
            and if i == i', j <= j'

        In other words, of all maximal matching blocks, return one that
        starts earliest in a, and of all those maximal matching blocks that
        start earliest in a, return the one that starts earliest in b.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, " abcd", "abcd abcd")

        Match(a=0, b=4, size=5)

        If isjunk is defined, first the longest matching block is
        determined as above, but with the additional restriction that no
        junk element appears in the block.  Then that block is extended as
        far as possible by matching (only) junk elements on both sides.  So
        the resulting block never matches on junk except as identical junk
        happens to be adjacent to an "interesting" match.

        Here's the same example as before, but considering blanks to be
        junk.  That prevents " abcd" from matching the " abcd" at the tail
        end of the second sequence directly.  Instead only the "abcd" can
        match, and matches the leftmost "abcd" in the second sequence:

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x==" ", " abcd", "abcd abcd")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
        Match(a=1, b=0, size=4)

        If no blocks match, return (alo, blo, 0).

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "ab", "c")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 2, 0, 1)
        Match(a=0, b=0, size=0)

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ?     ++
    -   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ?            ^                     ---- ^
    +   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ?           ++++ ^                      ^
    +   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ''
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible
          characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
          to leave linejunk None; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has
          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static
          definition the author has ever been able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.
        ''
        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.

        Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
        newlines. Such sequences can be obtained from the `readlines()` method
        of file-like objects.  The delta generated also consists of newline-
        terminated strings, ready to be printed as-is via the writelines()
        method of a file-like object.

        Example:

        >>> print(''.join(Differ().compare('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(True),
        ...                                'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(True))),

        ''Generate comparison results for a same-tagged range.''
        When replacing one block of lines with another, search the blocks
        for *similar* lines; the best-matching pair (if any) is used as a
        synch point, and intraline difference marking is done on the
        similar pair. Lots of work, but often worth it.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()
        >>> results = d._fancy_replace(['abcDefghiJkl\n'], 0, 1,
        ...                            ['abcdefGhijkl\n'], 0, 1)
        >>> print(''.join(results), end="")
        - abcDefghiJkl

        ?    ^  ^  ^
        ''
        Format "?" output and deal with tabs.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()

        ...                      '  ^ ^  ^      ', '  ^ ^  ^      ')
        >>> for line in results: print(repr(line))

    Return True for ignorable line: iff `line` is blank or contains a single '#'.

    Examples:

    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('  #   \n')
    True
    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('hello\n')

    ''
    Return True for ignorable character: iff `ch` is a space or tab.

    ''Convert range to the "ed" format''{},{}''
    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

    Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with ---, +++, or @@) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
    times.  Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
    'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

    Example:

    Context diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few

    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with *** or ---) are

    Compare `a` and `b`, two sequences of lines represented as bytes rather
    than str. This is a wrapper for `dfunc`, which is typically either
    unified_diff() or context_diff(). Inputs are losslessly converted to
    strings so that `dfunc` only has to worry about strings, and encoded
    back to bytes on return. This is necessary to compare files with
    unknown or inconsistent encoding. All other inputs (except `n`) must be
    bytes rather than str.
    ''all arguments must be bytes, not %s (%r)''
    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to

            '\0+' -- marks start of added text
            '\0-' -- marks start of deleted text
            '\0^' -- marks start of changed text
            '\1' -- marks end of added/deleted/changed text

    boolean flag -- None indicates context separation, True indicates
        either "from" or "to" line contains a change, otherwise False.

    This function/iterator was originally developed to generate side by side
    file difference for making HTML pages (see HtmlDiff class for example
    usage).

    Note, this function utilizes the ndiff function to generate the side by
    side difference markup.  Optional ndiff arguments may be passed to this
    function and they in turn will be passed to ndiff.
    ''(\++|\-+|\^+)''Returns line of text with user's change markup and line formatting.

        lines -- list of lines from the ndiff generator to produce a line of
                 text from.  When producing the line of text to return, the
                 lines used are removed from this list.
        format_key -- '+' return first line in list with "add" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '-' return first line in list with "delete" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '?' return first line in list with add/delete/change
                          intraline markup (indices obtained from second line)
                      None return first line in list with no markup
        side -- indice into the num_lines list (0=from,1=to)
        num_lines -- from/to current line number.  This is NOT intended to be a
                     passed parameter.  It is present as a keyword argument to
                     maintain memory of the current line numbers between calls
                     of this function.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.
        ''''Yields from/to lines of text with a change indication.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from a
        differencing iterator, processes them and yields them.  When it can
        it yields both a "from" and a "to" line, otherwise it will yield one
        or the other.  In addition to yielding the lines of from/to text, a
        boolean flag is yielded to indicate if the text line(s) have
        differences in them.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.
        ''-?+?''--++''--?+''--+''-+?''-?+''+--''+-''Yields from/to lines of text with a change indication.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from the line
        iterator.  Its difference from that iterator is that this function
        always yields a pair of from/to text lines (with the change
        indication).  If necessary it will collect single from/to lines
        until it has a matching pair from/to pair to yield.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.

    </table>''For producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.

    This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file
    containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison
    of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights.  The table can
    be generated in either full or contextual difference mode.

    The following methods are provided for HTML generation:

    make_table -- generates HTML for a single side by side table
    make_file -- generates complete HTML file with a single side by side table

    See tools/scripts/diff.py for an example usage of this class.
    ''HtmlDiff instance initializer

        Arguments:
        tabsize -- tab stop spacing, defaults to 8.
        wrapcolumn -- column number where lines are broken and wrapped,
            defaults to None where lines are not wrapped.
        linejunk,charjunk -- keyword arguments passed into ndiff() (used by
            HtmlDiff() to generate the side by side HTML differences).  See
            ndiff() documentation for argument default values and descriptions.
        ''Returns HTML file of side by side comparison with change highlights

        Arguments:
        fromlines -- list of "from" lines
        tolines -- list of "to" lines
        fromdesc -- "from" file column header string
        todesc -- "to" file column header string
        context -- set to True for contextual differences (defaults to False
            which shows full differences).
        numlines -- number of context lines.  When context is set True,
            controls number of lines displayed before and after the change.
            When context is False, controls the number of lines to place
            the "next" link anchors before the next change (so click of
            "next" link jumps to just before the change).
        charset -- charset of the HTML document
        ''Returns from/to line lists with tabs expanded and newlines removed.

        Instead of tab characters being replaced by the number of spaces
        needed to fill in to the next tab stop, this function will fill
        the space with tab characters.  This is done so that the difference
        algorithms can identify changes in a file when tabs are replaced by
        spaces and vice versa.  At the end of the HTML generation, the tab
        characters will be replaced with a nonbreakable space.
        ''Builds list of text lines by splitting text lines at wrap point

        This function will determine if the input text line needs to be
        wrapped (split) into separate lines.  If so, the first wrap point
        will be determined and the first line appended to the output
        text line list.  This function is used recursively to handle
        the second part of the split line to further split it.
        ''Returns iterator that splits (wraps) mdiff text lines''Collects mdiff output into separate lists

        Before storing the mdiff from/to data into a list, it is converted

    Generate one of the two sequences that generated a delta.

    Given a `delta` produced by `Differ.compare()` or `ndiff()`, extract
    lines originating from file 1 or 2 (parameter `which`), stripping off line
    prefixes.

    Examples:

    >>> diff = ndiff('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
    ...              'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))
    >>> diff = list(diff)

Utility functions for manipulating directories and directory trees.''Create a directory and any missing ancestor directories.

    If the directory already exists (or if 'name' is the empty string, which
    means the current directory, which of course exists), then do nothing.
    Raise DistutilsFileError if unable to create some directory along the way
    (eg. some sub-path exists, but is a file rather than a directory).
    If 'verbose' is true, print a one-line summary of each mkdir to stdout.
    Return the list of directories actually created.
    ''mkpath: 'name' must be a string (got %r)''normpath''creating %s''could not create '%s': %s''Create all the empty directories under 'base_dir' needed to put 'files'
    there.

    'base_dir' is just the name of a directory which doesn't necessarily
    exist yet; 'files' is a list of filenames to be interpreted relative to
    'base_dir'.  'base_dir' + the directory portion of every file in 'files'
    will be created if it doesn't already exist.  'mode', 'verbose' and
    'dry_run' flags are as for 'mkpath()'.
    ''Copy an entire directory tree 'src' to a new location 'dst'.

    Both 'src' and 'dst' must be directory names.  If 'src' is not a
    directory, raise DistutilsFileError.  If 'dst' does not exist, it is
    created with 'mkpath()'.  The end result of the copy is that every
    file in 'src' is copied to 'dst', and directories under 'src' are
    recursively copied to 'dst'.  Return the list of files that were
    copied or might have been copied, using their output name.  The
    return value is unaffected by 'update' or 'dry_run': it is simply
    the list of all files under 'src', with the names changed to be
    under 'dst'.

    'preserve_mode' and 'preserve_times' are the same as for
    'copy_file'; note that they only apply to regular files, not to
    directories.  If 'preserve_symlinks' is true, symlinks will be
    copied as symlinks (on platforms that support them!); otherwise
    (the default), the destination of the symlink will be copied.
    'update' and 'verbose' are the same as for 'copy_file'.
    ''cannot copy tree '%s': not a directory''error listing files in '%s': %s''.nfs''islink''readlink''linking %s -> %s''Helper for remove_tree().''rmdir''Recursively remove an entire directory tree.

    Any errors are ignored (apart from being reported to stdout if 'verbose'
    is true).
    ''removing '%s' (and everything under it)''error removing %s: %s''Take the full path 'path', and make it a relative path.

    This is useful to make 'path' the second argument to os.path.join().

In simplest use, end each module M to be tested with:

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

Then running the module as a script will cause the examples in the
docstrings to get executed and verified:

python M.py

This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the
failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout
(why not stderr? because stderr is a lame hack <0.2 wink>), and the final
line of output is "Test failed.".

Run it with the -v switch instead:

python M.py -v

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to stdout, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing "verbose=True" to testmod, or prohibit
it by passing "verbose=False".  In either of those cases, sys.argv is not
examined by testmod.

There are a variety of other ways to run doctests, including integration
with the unittest framework, and support for running non-Python text
files containing doctests.  There are also many ways to override parts
of doctest's default behaviors.  See the Library Reference Manual for
details.

    ''Expected a module: %r''Module-relative files may not have absolute paths''Can't resolve paths relative to the module %r (it has no __file__)''
    A single doctest example, consisting of source code and expected
    output.  `Example` defines the following attributes:

      - source: A single Python statement, always ending with a newline.
        The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - want: The expected output from running the source code (either
        from stdout, or a traceback in case of exception).  `want` ends
        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline
        if needed.

      - lineno: The line number within the DocTest string containing
        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or
        False, which is used to override default options for this
        example.  Any option flags not contained in this dictionary
        are left at their default value (as specified by the
        DocTestRunner's optionflags).  By default, no options are set.
    ''
    A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single
    namespace.  Each `DocTest` defines the following attributes:

      - examples: the list of examples.

      - globs: The namespace (aka globals) that the examples should
        be run in.

      - name: A name identifying the DocTest (typically, the name of
        the object whose docstring this DocTest was extracted from).

      - filename: The name of the file that this DocTest was extracted
        from, or `None` if the filename is unknown.

      - lineno: The line number within filename where this DocTest
        begins, or `None` if the line number is unavailable.  This
        line number is zero-based, with respect to the beginning of
        the file.

      - docstring: The string that the examples were extracted from,
        or `None` if the string is unavailable.

        Divide the given string into examples and intervening text,

        Line numbers for the Examples are 0-based.  The optional

        used for error messages.
        ''
        Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and
        collect them into a `DocTest` object.

        `globs`, `name`, `filename`, and `lineno` are attributes for
        the new `DocTest` object.  See the documentation for `DocTest`
        for more information.
        ''
        Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and return
        them as a list of `Example` objects.  Line numbers are
        0-based, because it's most common in doctests that nothing
        interesting appears on the same line as opening triple-quote,
        and so the first interesting line is called "line 1" then.

        The optional argument `name` is a name identifying this
        string, and is only used for error messages.
        ''
        Given a regular expression match from `_EXAMPLE_RE` (`m`),
        return a pair `(source, want)`, where `source` is the matched
        example's source code (with prompts and indentation stripped);
        and `want` is the example's expected output (with indentation
        stripped).

        `name` is the string's name, and `lineno` is the line number
        where the example starts; both are used for error messages.
        ''sl'' *$''#\s*doctest:\s*([^\n\'"]*)$''
        Return a dictionary containing option overrides extracted from
        option directives in the given source string.

        `name` is the string's name, and `lineno` is the line number

        ''line %r of the docstring for %s has inconsistent leading whitespace: %r''
    A class used to extract the DocTests that are relevant to a given
    object, from its docstring and the docstrings of its contained
    objects.  Doctests can currently be extracted from the following
    object types: modules, functions, classes, methods, staticmethods,
    classmethods, and properties.
    ''
        Create a new doctest finder.

        The optional argument `parser` specifies a class or
        function that should be used to create new DocTest objects (or
        objects that implement the same interface as DocTest).  The
        signature for this factory function should match the signature
        of the DocTest constructor.

        If the optional argument `recurse` is false, then `find` will
        only examine the given object, and not any contained objects.

        If the optional argument `exclude_empty` is false, then `find`
        will include tests for objects with empty docstrings.
        ''
        Return a list of the DocTests that are defined by the given
        object's docstring, or by any of its contained objects'
        docstrings.

        The optional parameter `module` is the module that contains
        the given object.  If the module is not specified or is None, then
        the test finder will attempt to automatically determine the
        correct module.  The object's module is used:

            - As a default namespace, if `globs` is not specified.
            - To prevent the DocTestFinder from extracting DocTests
              from objects that are imported from other modules.
            - To find the name of the file containing the object.
            - To help find the line number of the object within its
              file.

        Contained objects whose module does not match `module` are ignored.

        If `module` is False, no attempt to find the module will be made.
        This is obscure, of use mostly in tests:  if `module` is False, or
        is None but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are
        considered to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained
        objects will (recursively) be searched for doctests.

        The globals for each DocTest is formed by combining `globs`
        and `extraglobs` (bindings in `extraglobs` override bindings
        in `globs`).  A new copy of the globals dictionary is created
        for each DocTest.  If `globs` is not specified, then it
        defaults to the module's `__dict__`, if specified, or {}
        otherwise.  If `extraglobs` is not specified, then it defaults
        to {}.

        ''DocTestFinder.find: name must be given when obj.__name__ doesn't exist: %r''<]>''
        Return true if the given object is defined in the given
        module.
        ''object must be a class or function''
        Safely unwrap objects and determine if they are functions.
        ''
        Find tests for the given object and any contained objects, and
        add them to `tests`.
        ''Finding tests in %s''__test__''DocTestFinder.find: __test__ keys must be strings: %r''DocTestFinder.find: __test__ values must be strings, functions, methods, classes, or modules: %r''%s.__test__.%s''
        Return a DocTest for the given object, if it defines a docstring;
        otherwise, return None.
        ''
        Return a line number of the given object's docstring.

        Returns `None` if the given object does not have a docstring.
        ''^\s*class\s*%s\b''(^|.*:)\s*\w*("|\')''
    A class used to run DocTest test cases, and accumulate statistics.
    The `run` method is used to process a single DocTest case.  It
    returns a tuple `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of test cases
    tried, and `f` is the number of test cases that failed.

        >>> tests = DocTestFinder().find(_TestClass)
        >>> runner = DocTestRunner(verbose=False)
        >>> tests.sort(key = lambda test: test.name)
        >>> for test in tests:
        ...     print(test.name, '->', runner.run(test))
        _TestClass -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.__init__ -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.get -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.square -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=1)

    The `summarize` method prints a summary of all the test cases that
    have been run by the runner, and returns an aggregated `(f, t)`
    tuple:

        >>> runner.summarize(verbose=1)
        4 items passed all tests:
           2 tests in _TestClass
           2 tests in _TestClass.__init__
           2 tests in _TestClass.get
           1 tests in _TestClass.square
        7 tests in 4 items.
        7 passed and 0 failed.
        Test passed.
        TestResults(failed=0, attempted=7)

    The aggregated number of tried examples and failed examples is
    also available via the `tries` and `failures` attributes:

        >>> runner.tries
        7
        >>> runner.failures
        0

    The comparison between expected outputs and actual outputs is done
    by an `OutputChecker`.  This comparison may be customized with a
    number of option flags; see the documentation for `testmod` for
    more information.  If the option flags are insufficient, then the
    comparison may also be customized by passing a subclass of
    `OutputChecker` to the constructor.

    The test runner's display output can be controlled in two ways.
    First, an output function (`out) can be passed to
    `TestRunner.run`; this function will be called with strings that
    should be displayed.  It defaults to `sys.stdout.write`.  If
    capturing the output is not sufficient, then the display output
    can be also customized by subclassing DocTestRunner, and
    overriding the methods `report_start`, `report_success`,
    `report_unexpected_exception`, and `report_failure`.
    ''
        Create a new test runner.

        Optional keyword arg `checker` is the `OutputChecker` that
        should be used to compare the expected outputs and actual
        outputs of doctest examples.

        Optional keyword arg 'verbose' prints lots of stuff if true,
        only failures if false; by default, it's true iff '-v' is in
        sys.argv.

        Optional argument `optionflags` can be used to control how the
        test runner compares expected output to actual output, and how
        it displays failures.  See the documentation for `testmod` for
        more information.
        ''-v''
        Report that the test runner is about to process the given
        example.  (Only displays a message if verbose=True)
        ''Trying:
''Expecting:
''Expecting nothing
''
        Report that the given example ran successfully.  (Only
        displays a message if verbose=True)
        ''ok

        Report that the given example failed.
        ''
        Report that the given example raised an unexpected exception.
        ''Exception raised:
''File "%s", line %s, in %s''Line %s, in %s''Failed example:''
        Run the examples in `test`.  Write the outcome of each example
        with one of the `DocTestRunner.report_*` methods, using the
        writer function `out`.  `compileflags` is the set of compiler
        flags that should be used to execute examples.  Return a tuple
        `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of examples tried, and `f`
        is the number of examples that failed.  The examples are run
        in the namespace `test.globs`.
        ''examplenum''<doctest %s[%d]>''debugger''unknown outcome''
        Record the fact that the given DocTest (`test`) generated `f`
        failures out of `t` tried examples.
        ''<doctest (?P<name>.+)\[(?P<examplenum>\d+)\]>$''
        Run the examples in `test`, and display the results using the
        writer function `out`.

        The examples are run in the namespace `test.globs`.  If
        `clear_globs` is true (the default), then this namespace will
        be cleared after the test runs, to help with garbage
        collection.  If you would like to examine the namespace after
        the test completes, then use `clear_globs=False`.

        `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by
        the Python compiler when running the examples.  If not
        specified, then it will default to the set of future-import
        flags that apply to `globs`.

        The output of each example is checked using
        `DocTestRunner.check_output`, and the results are formatted by
        the `DocTestRunner.report_*` methods.
        ''
        Print a summary of all the test cases that have been run by
        this DocTestRunner, and return a tuple `(f, t)`, where `f` is
        the total number of failed examples, and `t` is the total
        number of tried examples.

        The optional `verbose` argument controls how detailed the
        summary is.  If the verbosity is not specified, then the
        DocTestRunner's verbosity is used.
        ''items had no tests:''items passed all tests:'' %3d tests in %s''items had failures:'' %3d of %3d in %s''tests in''items.''passed and''failed.''***Test Failed***''failures.''Test passed.''merge''
    A class used to check the whether the actual output from a doctest
    example matches the expected output.  `OutputChecker` defines two
    methods: `check_output`, which compares a given pair of outputs,
    and returns true if they match; and `output_difference`, which
    returns a string describing the differences between two outputs.
    ''
        Convert string to hex-escaped ASCII string.
        ''
        Return True iff the actual output from an example (`got`)
        matches the expected output (`want`).  These strings are
        always considered to match if they are identical; but
        depending on what option flags the test runner is using,
        several non-exact match types are also possible.  See the
        documentation for `TestRunner` for more information about
        option flags.

        Return a string describing the differences between the

    ''Run doc tests but raise an exception as soon as there is a failure.

       If an unexpected exception occurs, an UnexpectedException is raised.
       It contains the test, the example, and the original exception:

       We wrap the original exception to give the calling application
       access to the test and example information.

       If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

       DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

       As well as to the example:

         >>> failure.example.want

       and the actual output:

         >>> failure.got

    Also test examples reachable from dict m.__test__ if it exists and is

    function and class docstrings are tested even if the name is private;
    strings are tested directly, as if they were docstrings.

    Return (#failures, #tests).

    See help(doctest) for an overview.

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the module; by default
    use m.__name__.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use m.__dict__.  A copy of this
    dict is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.  This is new in 2.4.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,
    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  This is new in 2.3.  Possible values (see the
    docs for details):

        DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1
        DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE
        NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

        REPORT_CDIFF
        REPORT_NDIFF
        REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.
    Passing report=0 to testmod is especially useful then, to delay
    displaying a summary.  Invoke doctest.master.summarize(verbose)
    when you're done fiddling.
    ''testmod: module required; %r''
    Test examples in the given file.  Return (#failures, #tests).

    Optional keyword arg "module_relative" specifies how filenames
    should be interpreted:

      - If "module_relative" is True (the default), then "filename"
         specifies a module-relative path.  By default, this path is
         relative to the calling module's directory; but if the
         "package" argument is specified, then it is relative to that
         package.  To ensure os-independence, "filename" should use
         "/" characters to separate path segments, and should not
         be an absolute path (i.e., it may not begin with "/").

      - If "module_relative" is False, then "filename" specifies an
        os-specific path.  The path may be absolute or relative (to
        the current working directory).

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the test; by default
    use the file's basename.

    Optional keyword argument "package" is a Python package or the
    name of a Python package whose directory should be used as the
    base directory for a module relative filename.  If no package is
    specified, then the calling module's directory is used as the base
    directory for module relative filenames.  It is an error to
    specify "package" if "module_relative" is False.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use {}.  A copy of this dict
    is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,

    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  Possible values (see the docs for details):

        DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1
        DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE
        NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        ELLIPSIS
        SKIP
        IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
        REPORT_UDIFF
        REPORT_CDIFF
        REPORT_NDIFF
        REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Optional keyword arg "parser" specifies a DocTestParser (or
    subclass) that should be used to extract tests from the files.

    Optional keyword arg "encoding" specifies an encoding that should
    be used to convert the file to unicode.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.
    Passing report=0 to testmod is especially useful then, to delay
    displaying a summary.  Invoke doctest.master.summarize(verbose)
    when you're done fiddling.
    ''Package may only be specified for module-relative paths.''NoName''
    Test examples in the given object's docstring (`f`), using `globs`
    as globals.  Optional argument `name` is used in failure messages.
    If the optional argument `verbose` is true, then generate output
    even if there are no failures.

    `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by the
    Python compiler when running the examples.  If not specified, then
    it will default to the set of future-import flags that apply to
    `globs`.

    Optional keyword arg `optionflags` specifies options for the
    testing and output.  See the documentation for `testmod` for more
    information.
    ''Sets the unittest option flags.

    The old flag is returned so that a runner could restore the old
    value if it wished to:

      >>> import doctest

      >>> doctest.set_unittest_reportflags(REPORT_NDIFF |
      ...                          REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE) == old
      True

      >>> doctest._unittest_reportflags == (REPORT_NDIFF |
      ...                                   REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE)
      True

    Only reporting flags can be set:

      Traceback (most recent call last):

      ValueError: ('Only reporting flags allowed', 8)

      >>> doctest.set_unittest_reportflags(old) == (REPORT_NDIFF |

      True
    ''Only reporting flags allowed''unknown line number''Failed doctest test for %s
  File "%s", line %s, in %s

%s''Run the test case without results and without catching exceptions

           The unit test framework includes a debug method on test cases
           and test suites to support post-mortem debugging.  The test code
           is run in such a way that errors are not caught.  This way a
           caller can catch the errors and initiate post-mortem debugging.

           The DocTestCase provides a debug method that raises
           UnexpectedException errors if there is an unexpected
           exception:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
             ...                {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
             >>> case = DocTestCase(test)
             >>> try:
             ...     case.debug()
             ... except UnexpectedException as f:
             ...     failure = f

           The UnexpectedException contains the test, the example, and
           the original exception:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

             >>> failure.example.want
             '42\n'

             >>> exc_info = failure.exc_info
             >>> raise exc_info[1] # Already has the traceback
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             KeyError

           If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
             ...      >>> x = 1
             ...      >>> x
             ...      2
             ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
             >>> case = DocTestCase(test)

             >>> try:
             ...    case.debug()
             ... except DocTestFailure as f:
             ...    failure = f

           DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

           As well as to the example:

             >>> failure.example.want
             '2\n'

           and the actual output:

             >>> failure.got
             '1\n'

           ''Doctest: ''DocTestSuite will not work with -O2 and above''Skipping tests from %s''
    Convert doctest tests for a module to a unittest test suite.

    This converts each documentation string in a module that
    contains doctest tests to a unittest test case.  If any of the
    tests in a doc string fail, then the test case fails.  An exception
    is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a
    (sometimes approximate) line number.

    The `module` argument provides the module to be tested.  The argument
    can be either a module or a module name.

    If no argument is given, the calling module is used.

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
       A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.
    ''Failed doctest test for %s
  File "%s", line 0

%s''A unittest suite for one or more doctest files.

    The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
    interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
    "module_relative".

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    module_relative
      If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
      default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
      directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
      they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
      "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
      begin with "/").

      If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
      or relative (to the current working directory).

    package
      A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
      should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
      If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
      directory is used as the base directory for module relative
      filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
      "module_relative" is False.

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
      A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.

    parser
      A DocTestParser (or subclass) that should be used to extract
      tests from the files.

    encoding
      An encoding that will be used to convert the files to unicode.

        Either returns an existing member, or creates a new enum class.

        This method is used both when an enum class is given a value to match
        to an enumeration member (i.e. Color(3)) and for the functional API
        (i.e. Color = Enum('Color', names='RED GREEN BLUE')).

        When used for the functional API:

        `value` will be the name of the new class.

        `names` should be either a string of white-space/comma delimited names
        (values will start at `start`), or an iterator/mapping of name, value pairs.

        `module` should be set to the module this class is being created in;
        if it is not set, an attempt to find that module will be made, but if
        it fails the class will not be picklable.

        `qualname` should be set to the actual location this class can be found
        at in its module; by default it is set to the global scope.  If this is

The base exception class is URLError, which inherits from OSError.  It
doesn't define any behavior of its own, but is the base class for all
exceptions defined in this package.

HTTPError is an exception class that is also a valid HTTP response
instance.  It behaves this way because HTTP protocol errors are valid
responses, with a status code, headers, and a body.  In some contexts,
an application may want to handle an exception like a regular

The feed parser implements an interface for incrementally parsing an email
message, line by line.  This has advantages for certain applications, such as
those reading email messages off a socket.

FeedParser.feed() is the primary interface for pushing new data into the
parser.  It returns when there's nothing more it can do with the available
data.  When you have no more data to push into the parser, call .close().
This completes the parsing and returns the root message object.

The other advantage of this parser is that it will never raise a parsing
exception.  Instead, when it finds something unexpected, it adds a 'defect' to
the current message.  Defects are just instances that live on the message
object's .defects attribute.

    You can also push and pop line-matching predicates onto a stack.  When the
    current predicate matches the current line, a false EOF response
    (i.e. empty string) is returned instead.  This lets the parser adhere to a
    simple abstraction -- it parses until EOF closes the current message.

Utility functions for operating on single files.
''copying''hard linking''hard''symbolically linking''sym''Copy the file 'src' to 'dst'; both must be filenames.  Any error
    opening either file, reading from 'src', or writing to 'dst', raises
    DistutilsFileError.  Data is read/written in chunks of 'buffer_size'
    bytes (default 16k).  No attempt is made to handle anything apart from
    regular files.
    ''could not open '%s': %s''could not delete '%s': %s''could not read from '%s': %s''could not write to '%s': %s''Copy a file 'src' to 'dst'.  If 'dst' is a directory, then 'src' is
    copied there with the same name; otherwise, it must be a filename.  (If
    the file exists, it will be ruthlessly clobbered.)  If 'preserve_mode'
    is true (the default), the file's mode (type and permission bits, or
    whatever is analogous on the current platform) is copied.  If
    'preserve_times' is true (the default), the last-modified and
    last-access times are copied as well.  If 'update' is true, 'src' will
    only be copied if 'dst' does not exist, or if 'dst' does exist but is
    older than 'src'.

    'link' allows you to make hard links (os.link) or symbolic links
    (os.symlink) instead of copying: set it to "hard" or "sym"; if it is
    None (the default), files are copied.  Don't set 'link' on systems that
    don't support it: 'copy_file()' doesn't check if hard or symbolic
    linking is available. If hardlink fails, falls back to
    _copy_file_contents().

    Under Mac OS, uses the native file copy function in macostools; on
    other systems, uses '_copy_file_contents()' to copy file contents.

    Return a tuple (dest_name, copied): 'dest_name' is the actual name of

        are not quite the same as implemented by the 'fnmatch' module: '*'
        and '?'  match non-special characters, where "special" is platform-
        dependent: slash on Unix; colon, slash, and backslash on
        DOS/Windows; and colon on Mac OS.

        If 'anchor' is true (the default), then the pattern match is more
        stringent: "*.py" will match "foo.py" but not "foo/bar.py".  If
        'anchor' is false, both of these will match.

        If 'prefix' is supplied, then only filenames starting with 'prefix'
        (itself a pattern) and ending with 'pattern', with anything in between
        them, will match.  'anchor' is ignored in this case.

        If 'is_regex' is true, 'anchor' and 'prefix' are ignored, and
        'pattern' is assumed to be either a string containing a regex or a
        regex object -- no translation is done, the regex is just compiled
        and used as-is.

fnmatch(FILENAME, PATTERN) matches according to the local convention.
fnmatchcase(FILENAME, PATTERN) always takes case in account.

The functions operate by translating the pattern into a regular
expression.  They cache the compiled regular expressions for speed.

The function translate(PATTERN) returns a regular expression
corresponding to PATTERN.  (It does not compile it.)
''fnmatchcase''Test whether FILENAME matches PATTERN.

    Patterns are Unix shell style:

    *       matches everything
    ?       matches any single character
    [seq]   matches any character in seq
    [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

    An initial period in FILENAME is not special.
    Both FILENAME and PATTERN are first case-normalized
    if the operating system requires it.
    If you don't want this, use fnmatchcase(FILENAME, PATTERN).

''This class implements rational numbers.

    In the two-argument form of the constructor, Fraction(8, 6) will
    produce a rational number equivalent to 4/3. Both arguments must
    be Rational. The numerator defaults to 0 and the denominator
    defaults to 1 so that Fraction(3) == 3 and Fraction() == 0.

    Fractions can also be constructed from:

      - numeric strings similar to those accepted by the
        float constructor (for example, '-2.3' or '1e10')

      - strings of the form '123/456'

      - float and Decimal instances

      - other Rational instances (including integers)

    ''_numerator''_denominator''Constructs a Rational.

        Takes a string like '3/2' or '1.5', another Rational instance, a
        numerator/denominator pair, or a float.

        operator and a function from the operator module.

        Use this like:

        In general, we want to implement the arithmetic operations so
        that mixed-mode operations either call an implementation whose
        author knew about the types of both arguments, or convert both
        to the nearest built in type and do the operation there. In
        Fraction, that means that we define __add__ and __radd__ as:

            def __add__(self, other):
                # Both types have numerators/denominator attributes,
                # so do the operation directly
                if isinstance(other, (int, Fraction)):
                    return Fraction(self.numerator * other.denominator +
                                    other.numerator * self.denominator,

                # float and complex don't have those operations, but we
                # know about those types, so special case them.
                elif isinstance(other, float):
                    return float(self) + other
                elif isinstance(other, complex):
                    return complex(self) + other
                # Let the other type take over.
                return NotImplemented

            def __radd__(self, other):
                # radd handles more types than add because there's
                # nothing left to fall back to.
                if isinstance(other, numbers.Rational):
                    return Fraction(self.numerator * other.denominator +
                                    other.numerator * self.denominator,
                                    self.denominator * other.denominator)
                elif isinstance(other, Real):
                    return float(other) + float(self)
                elif isinstance(other, Complex):

                return NotImplemented


        There are 5 different cases for a mixed-type addition on
        Fraction. I'll refer to all of the above code that doesn't
        refer to Fraction, float, or complex as "boilerplate". 'r'
        will be an instance of Fraction, which is a subtype of
        Rational (r : Fraction <: Rational), and b : B <:
        Complex. The first three involve 'r + b':

            1. If B <: Fraction, int, float, or complex, we handle
               that specially, and all is well.
            2. If Fraction falls back to the boilerplate code, and it
               were to return a value from __add__, we'd miss the
               possibility that B defines a more intelligent __radd__,
               so the boilerplate should return NotImplemented from
               __add__. In particular, we don't handle Rational
               here, even though we could get an exact answer, in case
               the other type wants to do something special.
            3. If B <: Fraction, Python tries B.__radd__ before
               Fraction.__add__. This is ok, because it was
               implemented with knowledge of Fraction, so it can
               handle those instances before delegating to Real or
               Complex.

        The next two situations describe 'b + r'. We assume that b
        didn't know about Fraction in its implementation, and that it
        uses similar boilerplate code:

            4. If B <: Rational, then __radd_ converts both to the
               builtin rational type (hey look, that's us) and
               proceeds.
            5. Otherwise, __radd__ tries to find the nearest common
               base ABC, and fall back to its builtin type. Since this
               class doesn't subclass a concrete type, there's no
               implementation to fall back to, so we need to try as
               hard as possible to return an actual value, or the user
               will get a TypeError.

        ''Real''__r''a + b''da''nb''a - b''a * b''a / b''a // b''(a // b, a % b)''a % b''a ** b

        If b is not an integer, the result will be a float or complex
        since roots are generally irrational. If b is an integer, the
        result will be rational.

        ''a ** b''+a: Coerces a subclass instance to Fraction''abs(a)''trunc(a)''math.floor(a)''math.ceil(a)''round(self, ndigits)

        Rounds half toward even.
        ''hash(self)''a == b''Helper for comparison operators, for internal use only.

        Implement comparison between a Rational instance `self`, and
        either another Rational instance or a float `other`.  If
        `other` is not a Rational instance or a float, return
        NotImplemented. `op` should be one of the six standard
        comparison operators.

''FTP''error_reply''error_temp''error_perm''error_proto''all_errors''An FTP client class.

    To create a connection, call the class using these arguments:
            host, user, passwd, acct, timeout, source_address, encoding

    The first four arguments are all strings, and have default value ''.
    The parameter timeout must be numeric and defaults to None if not
    passed, meaning that no timeout will be set on any ftp socket(s).
    If a timeout is passed, then this is now the default timeout for all ftp
    socket operations for this instance.
    The last parameter is the encoding of filenames, which defaults to utf-8.

    Then use self.connect() with optional host and port argument.

    To download a file, use ftp.retrlines('RETR ' + filename),
    or ftp.retrbinary() with slightly different arguments.
    To upload a file, use ftp.storlines() or ftp.storbinary(),
    which have an open file as argument (see their definitions
    below for details).
    The download/upload functions first issue appropriate TYPE
    and PORT or PASV commands.
    ''user''Initialization method (called by class instantiation).
        Initialize host to localhost, port to standard ftp port.
        Optional arguments are host (for connect()),
        and user, passwd, acct (for login()).
        ''login''Connect to host.  Arguments are:
         - host: hostname to connect to (string, default previous host)
         - port: port to connect to (integer, default previous port)
         - timeout: the timeout to set against the ftp socket(s)
         - source_address: a 2-tuple (host, port) for the socket to bind

    reduce(function, iterable[, initial]) -> value

    Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence

    Adapted from https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/.

    ''Inconsistent hierarchy''Computes the method resolution order using extended C3 linearization.

    If no *abcs* are given, the algorithm works exactly like the built-in C3
    linearization used for method resolution.

    If given, *abcs* is a list of abstract base classes that should be inserted
    into the resulting MRO. Unrelated ABCs are ignored and don't end up in the
    result. The algorithm inserts ABCs where their functionality is introduced,
    i.e. issubclass(cls, abc) returns True for the class itself but returns
    False for all its direct base classes. Implicit ABCs for a given class
    (either registered or inferred from the presence of a special method like
    __len__) are inserted directly after the last ABC explicitly listed in the
    MRO of said class. If two implicit ABCs end up next to each other in the
    resulting MRO, their ordering depends on the order of types in *abcs*.

This module helps scripts to parse the command line arguments in
sys.argv.  It supports the same conventions as the Unix getopt()
function (including the special meanings of arguments of the form `-'
and `--').  Long options similar to those supported by GNU software
may be used as well via an optional third argument.  This module
provides two functions and an exception:

getopt() -- Parse command line options
gnu_getopt() -- Like getopt(), but allow option and non-option arguments
to be intermixed.
GetoptError -- exception (class) raised with 'opt' attribute, which is the
option involved with the exception.
''GetoptError''gnu_getopt''getopt(args, options[, long_options]) -> opts, args

    Parses command line options and parameter list.  args is the
    argument list to be parsed, without the leading reference to the
    running program.  Typically, this means "sys.argv[1:]".  shortopts
    is the string of option letters that the script wants to
    recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a
    colon (i.e., the same format that Unix getopt() uses).  If
    specified, longopts is a list of strings with the names of the
    long options which should be supported.  The leading '--'
    characters should not be included in the option name.  Options
    which require an argument should be followed by an equal sign
    ('=').

    The return value consists of two elements: the first is a list of
    (option, value) pairs; the second is the list of program arguments
    left after the option list was stripped (this is a trailing slice
    of the first argument).  Each option-and-value pair returned has
    the option as its first element, prefixed with a hyphen (e.g.,
    '-x'), and the option argument as its second element, or an empty
    string if the option has no argument.  The options occur in the
    list in the same order in which they were found, thus allowing
    multiple occurrences.  Long and short options may be mixed.

    ''getopt(args, options[, long_options]) -> opts, args

    This function works like getopt(), except that GNU style scanning
    mode is used by default. This means that option and non-option
    arguments may be intermixed. The getopt() function stops
    processing options as soon as a non-option argument is
    encountered.

    If the first character of the option string is `+', or if the
    environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then option
    processing stops as soon as a non-option argument is encountered.

This module provides internationalization (I18N) and localization (L10N)
support for your Python programs by providing an interface to the GNU gettext
message catalog library.

I18N refers to the operation by which a program is made aware of multiple
languages.  L10N refers to the adaptation of your program, once
internationalized, to the local language and cultural habits.

    ''[\1]''O_DIRECTORY''This module defines the data structures used to represent a grammar.

These are a bit arcane because they are derived from the data
structures used by Python's 'pgen' parser generator.

There's also a table here mapping operators to their names in the
token module; the Python tokenize module reports all operators as the
fallback token code OP, but the parser needs the actual token code.

''Pgen parsing tables conversion class.

    Once initialized, this class supplies the grammar tables for the
    parsing engine implemented by parse.py.  The parsing engine
    accesses the instance variables directly.  The class here does not
    provide initialization of the tables; several subclasses exist to
    do this (see the conv and pgen modules).

    The load() method reads the tables from a pickle file, which is
    much faster than the other ways offered by subclasses.  The pickle
    file is written by calling dump() (after loading the grammar
    tables using a subclass).  The report() method prints a readable
    representation of the tables to stdout, for debugging.

    The instance variables are as follows:

    symbol2number -- a dict mapping symbol names to numbers.  Symbol
                     numbers are always 256 or higher, to distinguish
                     them from token numbers, which are between 0 and
                     255 (inclusive).

    number2symbol -- a dict mapping numbers to symbol names;
                     these two are each other's inverse.

    states        -- a list of DFAs, where each DFA is a list of
                     states, each state is a list of arcs, and each
                     arc is a (i, j) pair where i is a label and j is
                     a state number.  The DFA number is the index into
                     this list.  (This name is slightly confusing.)
                     Final states are represented by a special arc of
                     the form (0, j) where j is its own state number.

    dfas          -- a dict mapping symbol numbers to (DFA, first)
                     pairs, where DFA is an item from the states list
                     above, and first is a set of tokens that can
                     begin this grammar rule (represented by a dict
                     whose values are always 1).

    labels        -- a list of (x, y) pairs where x is either a token
                     number or a symbol number, and y is either None
                     or a string; the strings are keywords.  The label
                     number is the index in this list; label numbers
                     are used to mark state transitions (arcs) in the
                     DFAs.

    start         -- the number of the grammar's start symbol.

''Functions that read and write gzipped files.

The user of the file doesn't have to worry about the compression,
but random access is not allowed.''BadGzipFile''Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode.

    The filename argument can be an actual filename (a str or bytes object), or
    an existing file object to read from or write to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb", "w", "wb", "x", "xb", "a" or "ab" for
    binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt" or "at" for text mode. The default mode is
    "rb", and the default compresslevel is 9.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the GzipFile constructor:
    GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel). In this case, the encoding, errors
    and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, a GzipFile object is created, and wrapped in an
    io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error handling
    behavior, and line ending(s).

    ''filename must be a str or bytes object, or a file''<L''Minimal read-only file object that prepends a string to the contents
    of an actual file. Shouldn't be used outside of gzip.py, as it lacks
    essential functionality.''Exception raised in some cases for invalid gzip files.''The GzipFile class simulates most of the methods of a file object with
    the exception of the truncate() method.

    This class only supports opening files in binary mode. If you need to open a
    compressed file in text mode, use the gzip.open() function.

    ''Constructor for the GzipFile class.

        At least one of fileobj and filename must be given a
        non-trivial value.

        The new class instance is based on fileobj, which can be a regular
        file, an io.BytesIO object, or any other object which simulates a file.
        It defaults to None, in which case filename is opened to provide
        a file object.

        When fileobj is not None, the filename argument is only used to be
        included in the gzip file header, which may include the original
        filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the filename of
        fileobj, if discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string,
        and in this case the original filename is not included in the header.

        The mode argument can be any of 'r', 'rb', 'a', 'ab', 'w', 'wb', 'x', or
        'xb' depending on whether the file will be read or written.  The default
        is the mode of fileobj if discernible; otherwise, the default is 'rb'.
        A mode of 'r' is equivalent to one of 'rb', and similarly for 'w' and
        'wb', 'a' and 'ab', and 'x' and 'xb'.

        The compresslevel argument is an integer from 0 to 9 controlling the
        level of compression; 1 is fastest and produces the least compression,
        and 9 is slowest and produces the most compression. 0 is no compression
        at all. The default is 9.

        The mtime argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written
        to the last modification time field in the stream when compressing.
        If omitted or None, the current time is used.

to find out what algorithm names can be passed to new().

NOTE: If you want the adler32 or crc32 hash functions they are available in
the zlib module.

Choose your hash function wisely.  Some have known collision weaknesses.
sha384 and sha512 will be slow on 32 bit platforms.

Hash objects have these methods:
 - update(data): Update the hash object with the bytes in data. Repeated calls
                 are equivalent to a single call with the concatenation of all
                 the arguments.
 - digest():     Return the digest of the bytes passed to the update() method
                 so far as a bytes object.
 - hexdigest():  Like digest() except the digest is returned as a string
                 of double length, containing only hexadecimal digits.
 - copy():       Return a copy (clone) of the hash object. This can be used to
                 efficiently compute the digests of datas that share a common
                 initial substring.

For example, to obtain the digest of the byte string 'Nobody inspects the
spammish repetition':

    >>> import hashlib
    >>> m = hashlib.md5()
    >>> m.update(b"Nobody inspects")
    >>> m.update(b" the spammish repetition")
    >>> m.digest()
    b'\xbbd\x9c\x83\xdd\x1e\xa5\xc9\xd9\xde\xc9\xa1\x8d\xf0\xff\xe9'

    otherwise a lower-case string containing the name of the character set
    specified in the encoded string.

    header may be a string that may or may not contain RFC2047 encoded words,

    decode_header() takes a header value string and returns a sequence of
    pairs of the format (decoded_string, charset) where charset is the string
    name of the character set.

    This function takes one of those sequence of pairs and returns a Header
    instance.  Optional maxlinelen, header_name, and continuation_ws are as in
    the Header constructor.
    ''Create a MIME-compliant header that can contain many character sets.

        Optional s is the initial header value.  If None, the initial header

        method calls.  s may be a byte string or a Unicode string, but see the
        .append() documentation for semantics.

        Optional charset serves two purposes: it has the same meaning as the
        charset argument to the .append() method.  It also sets the default
        character set for all subsequent .append() calls that omit the charset
        argument.  If charset is not provided in the constructor, the us-ascii
        charset is used both as s's initial charset and as the default for
        subsequent .append() calls.

        The maximum line length can be specified explicitly via maxlinelen. For
        splitting the first line to a shorter value (to account for the field
        header which isn't included in s, e.g. `Subject') pass in the name of
        the field in header_name.  The default maxlinelen is 78 as recommended
        by RFC 2822.

        continuation_ws must be RFC 2822 compliant folding whitespace (usually
        either a space or a hard tab) which will be prepended to continuation
        lines.

        errors is passed through to the .append() call.
        ''Return the string value of the header.''Append a string to the MIME header.

        Optional charset, if given, should be a Charset instance or the name
        of a character set (which will be converted to a Charset instance).  A
        value of None (the default) means that the charset given in the
        constructor is used.

        s may be a byte string or a Unicode string.  If it is a byte string
        (i.e. isinstance(s, str) is false), then charset is the encoding of
        that byte string, and a UnicodeError will be raised if the string
        cannot be decoded with that charset.  If s is a Unicode string, then
        charset is a hint specifying the character set of the characters in
        the string.  In either case, when producing an RFC 2822 compliant
        header using RFC 2047 rules, the string will be encoded using the
        output codec of the charset.  If the string cannot be encoded to the
        output codec, a UnicodeError will be raised.

        7-bit ASCII, care must be taken to properly convert and encode (with
        Base64 or quoted-printable) header strings.  In addition, there is a
        75-character length limit on any given encoded header field, so
        line-wrapping must be performed, even with double-byte character sets.

        Optional maxlinelen specifies the maximum length of each generated
        line, exclusive of the linesep string.  Individual lines may be longer
        than maxlinelen if a folding point cannot be found.  The first line
        will be shorter by the length of the header name plus ": " if a header

        Optional splitchars is a string containing characters which should be
        given extra weight by the splitting algorithm during normal header
        wrapping.  This is in very rough support of RFC 2822's `higher level
        syntactic breaks':  split points preceded by a splitchar are preferred
        during line splitting, with the characters preferred in the order in
        which they appear in the string.  Space and tab may be included in the
        string to indicate whether preference should be given to one over the

        line separators when needed.
        ''header value appears to contain an embedded header: {!r}''(['']+)''Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

Usage:

heap = []            # creates an empty heap
heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
                               # new item; the heap size is unchanged

Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:

- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
  index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
  obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.

- Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.

These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
maintains the heap invariant!
''Heap queues

[explanation by Franois Pinard]

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

The strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory
representation for a tournament.  The numbers below are `k', not a[k]:

                                   0

                  1                                 2

          3               4                5               6

      7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14

    15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30


In the tree above, each cell `k' is topping `2*k+1' and `2*k+2'.  In
a usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner
over the two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree
to see all opponents s/he had.  However, in many computer applications
of such tournaments, we do not need to trace the history of a winner.
To be more memory efficient, when a winner is promoted, we try to
replace it by something else at a lower level, and the rule becomes
that a cell and the two cells it tops contain three different items,
but the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.

If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly
the overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and
find the "next" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the
diagram above) into the 0 position, and then percolate this new 0 down
the tree, exchanging values, until the invariant is re-established.
This is clearly logarithmic on the total number of items in the tree.
By iterating over all items, you get an O(n ln n) sort.

A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new
items while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are
not "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is
especially useful in simulation contexts, where the tree holds all
incoming events, and the "win" condition means the smallest scheduled
time.  When an event schedule other events for execution, they are
scheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the heap.  So, a
heap is a good structure for implementing schedulers (this is what I
used for my MIDI sequencer :-).

Various structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively
studied, and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy,
the speed is almost constant, and the worst case is not much different
than the average case.  However, there are other representations which
are more efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible.

Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all
know that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted
sequences, which size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory),
followed by a merging passes for these runs, which merging is often
very cleverly organised[1].  It is very important that the initial
sort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way
to that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you
replace and percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll
produce runs which are twice the size of the memory for random input,
and much better for input fuzzily ordered.

Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which
may not fit in the current tournament (because the value "wins" over
the last output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the
heap decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately
for progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the
same rate the first heap is melting.  When the first heap completely
vanishes, you switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and quite
effective!

In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in
a few applications, and I think it is good to keep a `heap' module
around. :-)

--------------------
[1] The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are
more annoying than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking
capabilities of the disks.  On devices which cannot seek, like big
tape drives, the story was quite different, and one had to be very
clever to ensure (far in advance) that each tape movement will be the
most effective possible (that is, will best participate at
"progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read
backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.
Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!
From all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)
''nsmallest''Push item onto heap, maintaining the heap invariant.''Pop the smallest item off the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.''Pop and return the current smallest value, and add the new item.

    This is more efficient than heappop() followed by heappush(), and can be
    more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap.  Note that the value
    returned may be larger than item!  That constrains reasonable uses of
    this routine unless written as part of a conditional replacement:

        if item > heap[0]:
            item = heapreplace(heap, item)

This module encapsulates the interface provided by the internal special
attributes (co_*, im_*, tb_*, etc.) in a friendlier fashion.
It also provides some help for examining source code and class layout.

Here are some of the useful functions provided by this module:

    ismodule(), isclass(), ismethod(), isfunction(), isgeneratorfunction(),
        isgenerator(), istraceback(), isframe(), iscode(), isbuiltin(),
        isroutine() - check object types
    getmembers() - get members of an object that satisfy a given condition

    getfile(), getsourcefile(), getsource() - find an object's source code
    getdoc(), getcomments() - get documentation on an object
    getmodule() - determine the module that an object came from
    getclasstree() - arrange classes so as to represent their hierarchy

    getargvalues(), getcallargs() - get info about function arguments
    getfullargspec() - same, with support for Python 3 features
    formatargvalues() - format an argument spec
    getouterframes(), getinnerframes() - get info about frames
    currentframe() - get the current stack frame
    stack(), trace() - get info about frames on the stack or in a traceback

    signature() - get a Signature object for the callable

    get_annotations() - safely compute an object's annotations
''Ka-Ping Yee <ping@lfw.org>''Yury Selivanov <yselivanov@sprymix.com>''CO_''Compute the annotations dict for an object.

    obj may be a callable, class, or module.
    Passing in an object of any other type raises TypeError.

    Returns a dict.  get_annotations() returns a new dict every time
    it's called; calling it twice on the same object will return two
    different but equivalent dicts.

    This function handles several details for you:

      * If eval_str is true, values of type str will
        be un-stringized using eval().  This is intended
        for use with stringized annotations
        ("from __future__ import annotations").
      * If obj doesn't have an annotations dict, returns an
        empty dict.  (Functions and methods always have an
        annotations dict; classes, modules, and other types of
        callables may not.)
      * Ignores inherited annotations on classes.  If a class
        doesn't have its own annotations dict, returns an empty dict.
      * All accesses to object members and dict values are done
        using getattr() and dict.get() for safety.
      * Always, always, always returns a freshly-created dict.

    eval_str controls whether or not values of type str are replaced
    with the result of calling eval() on those values:

      * If eval_str is true, eval() is called on values of type str.
      * If eval_str is false (the default), values of type str are unchanged.

    globals and locals are passed in to eval(); see the documentation
    for eval() for more information.  If either globals or locals is
    None, this function may replace that value with a context-specific
    default, contingent on type(obj):

      * If obj is a module, globals defaults to obj.__dict__.
      * If obj is a class, globals defaults to
        sys.modules[obj.__module__].__dict__ and locals
        defaults to the obj class namespace.
      * If obj is a callable, globals defaults to obj.__globals__,
        although if obj is a wrapped function (using
        functools.update_wrapper()) it is first unwrapped.

The
builtin open function is defined in this module.

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.

Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.

BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.

Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
is an in-memory stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

data:

DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE

   An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered
   I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if
   possible.

        All test modules must be importable from the top level of the project.
        If the start directory is not the top level directory then the top
        level directory must be specified separately.

        If a test package name (directory with '__init__.py') matches the
        pattern then the package will be checked for a 'load_tests' function. If
        this exists then it will be called with (loader, tests, pattern) unless
        the package has already had load_tests called from the same discovery
        invocation, in which case the package module object is not scanned for
        tests - this ensures that when a package uses discover to further
        discover child tests that infinite recursion does not happen.

        If load_tests exists then discovery does *not* recurse into the package,
        load_tests is responsible for loading all tests in the package.

        The pattern is deliberately not stored as a loader attribute so that
        packages can continue discovery themselves. top_level_dir is stored so
        load_tests does not need to pass this argument in to loader.discover().

        Paths are sorted before being imported to ensure reproducible execution

The module provides low-level access to the C lib's locale APIs and adds high
level number formatting APIs as well as a locale aliasing engine to complement
these.

The aliasing engine includes support for many commonly used locale names and
maps them to values suitable for passing to the C lib's setlocale() function. It
also includes default encodings for all supported locale names.

        name.

        The returned locale code is formatted for use with
        setlocale().

        If normalization fails, the original name is returned
        unchanged.

        If the given encoding is not known, the function defaults to
        the default encoding for the locale code just like setlocale()
        does.

    '' Parses the locale code for localename and returns the
        result as tuple (language code, encoding).

        The localename is normalized and passed through the locale
        alias engine. A ValueError is raised in case the locale name
        cannot be parsed.

        The language code corresponds to RFC 1766.  code and encoding
        can be None in case the values cannot be determined or are
        unknown to this implementation.

    ''unknown locale: %s'' Builds a locale code from the given tuple (language code,
        encoding).

        No aliasing or normalizing takes place.

    ''Locale must be None, a string, or an iterable of two strings -- language code, encoding.'' Tries to determine the default locale settings and returns
        them as tuple (language code, encoding).

        According to POSIX, a program which has not called
        setlocale(LC_ALL, "") runs using the portable 'C' locale.
        Calling setlocale(LC_ALL, "") lets it use the default locale as
        defined by the LANG variable. Since we don't want to interfere
        with the current locale setting we thus emulate the behavior
        in the way described above.

        To maintain compatibility with other platforms, not only the
        LANG variable is tested, but a list of variables given as
        envvars parameter. The first found to be defined will be
        used. envvars defaults to the search path used in GNU gettext;
        it must always contain the variable name 'LANG'.

        Except for the code 'C', the language code corresponds to RFC
        1766.  code and encoding can be None in case the values cannot
        be determined.

    ''0x'' Returns the current setting for the given locale category as
        tuple (language code, encoding).

        category may be one of the LC_* value except LC_ALL. It
        defaults to LC_CTYPE.

        Except for the code 'C', the language code corresponds to RFC
        1766.  code and encoding can be None in case the values cannot
        be determined.

    ''category LC_ALL is not supported'' Set the locale for the given category.  The locale can be
        a string, an iterable of two strings (language code and encoding),
        or None.

        Iterables are converted to strings using the locale aliasing
        engine.  Locale strings are passed directly to the C lib.

        category may be given as one of the LC_* values.

    '' Sets the locale for category to the default setting.

        The default setting is determined by calling
        getdefaultlocale(). category defaults to LC_ALL.

    A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned
    by a particular coroutine when locked.  A primitive lock is in one
    of two states, 'locked' or 'unlocked'.

    It is created in the unlocked state.  It has two basic methods,
    acquire() and release().  When the state is unlocked, acquire()
    changes the state to locked and returns immediately.  When the
    state is locked, acquire() blocks until a call to release() in
    another coroutine changes it to unlocked, then the acquire() call
    resets it to locked and returns.  The release() method should only
    be called in the locked state; it changes the state to unlocked
    and returns immediately.  If an attempt is made to release an
    unlocked lock, a RuntimeError will be raised.

    When more than one coroutine is blocked in acquire() waiting for
    the state to turn to unlocked, only one coroutine proceeds when a
    release() call resets the state to unlocked; first coroutine which
    is blocked in acquire() is being processed.

    acquire() is a coroutine and should be called with 'await'.

    Locks also support the asynchronous context management protocol.
    'async with lock' statement should be used.

    Usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        await lock.acquire()
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            lock.release()

    Context manager usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        async with lock:
             ...

    Lock objects can be tested for locking state:

        if not lock.locked():
           await lock.acquire()
        else:
           # lock is acquired
           ...

    ''unlocked'', waiters:'']>''Return True if lock is acquired.''Acquire a lock.

        This method blocks until the lock is unlocked, then sets it to
        locked and returns True.
        ''Release a lock.

        When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked, and return.
        If any other coroutines are blocked waiting for the lock to become
        unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed.

        When invoked on an unlocked lock, a RuntimeError is raised.

        There is no return value.
        ''Lock is not acquired.''Wake up the first waiter if it isn't done.''Asynchronous equivalent to threading.Event.

    Class implementing event objects. An event manages a flag that can be set
    to true with the set() method and reset to false with the clear() method.
    The wait() method blocks until the flag is true. The flag is initially
    false.
    ''Return True if and only if the internal flag is true.''Set the internal flag to true. All coroutines waiting for it to
        become true are awakened. Coroutine that call wait() once the flag is
        true will not block at all.
        ''Reset the internal flag to false. Subsequently, coroutines calling
        wait() will block until set() is called to set the internal flag
        to true again.''Block until the internal flag is true.

        If the internal flag is true on entry, return True

    allows one or more coroutines to wait until they are notified by another

    ''Wait until notified.

        If the calling coroutine has not acquired the lock when this

        This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks
        until it is awakened by a notify() or notify_all() call for
        the same condition variable in another coroutine.  Once
        awakened, it re-acquires the lock and returns True.

        Note: an awakened coroutine does not actually return from its

        not release the lock, its caller should.

        a RuntimeError is raised.
        ''A Semaphore implementation.

    A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each
    acquire() call and incremented by each release() call. The counter
    can never go below zero; when acquire() finds that it is zero, it blocks,
    waiting until some other thread calls release().

    Semaphores also support the context management protocol.

This module provides a class for reading and writing compressed files,
classes for incremental (de)compression, and convenience functions for
one-shot (de)compression.

These classes and functions support both the XZ and legacy LZMA
container formats, as well as raw compressed data streams.
''LZMAFile''A file object providing transparent LZMA (de)compression.

    An LZMAFile can act as a wrapper for an existing file object, or
    refer directly to a named file on disk.

    Note that LZMAFile provides a *binary* file interface - data read
    is returned as bytes, and data to be written must be given as bytes.
    ''Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary mode.

        filename can be either an actual file name (given as a str,
        bytes, or PathLike object), in which case the named file is
        opened, or it can be an existing file object to read from or
        write to.

        mode can be "r" for reading (default), "w" for (over)writing,
        "x" for creating exclusively, or "a" for appending. These can
        equivalently be given as "rb", "wb", "xb" and "ab" respectively.

        format specifies the container format to use for the file.
        If mode is "r", this defaults to FORMAT_AUTO. Otherwise, the
        default is FORMAT_XZ.

        check specifies the integrity check to use. This argument can
        only be used when opening a file for writing. For FORMAT_XZ,
        the default is CHECK_CRC64. FORMAT_ALONE and FORMAT_RAW do not
        support integrity checks - for these formats, check must be
        omitted, or be CHECK_NONE.

        When opening a file for reading, the *preset* argument is not
        meaningful, and should be omitted. The *filters* argument should
        also be omitted, except when format is FORMAT_RAW (in which case
        it is required).

        When opening a file for writing, the settings used by the
        compressor can be specified either as a preset compression
        level (with the *preset* argument), or in detail as a custom
        filter chain (with the *filters* argument). For FORMAT_XZ and
        FORMAT_ALONE, the default is to use the PRESET_DEFAULT preset
        level. For FORMAT_RAW, the caller must always specify a filter
        chain; the raw compressor does not support preset compression
        levels.

        preset (if provided) should be an integer in the range 0-9,
        optionally OR-ed with the constant PRESET_EXTREME.

        filters (if provided) should be a sequence of dicts. Each dict
        should have an entry for "id" indicating ID of the filter, plus
        additional entries for options to the filter.
        ''Cannot specify an integrity check when opening a file for reading''Cannot specify a preset compression level when opening a file for reading''Read up to size uncompressed bytes from the file.

        If size is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
        Returns b"" if the file is already at EOF.
        ''Read up to size uncompressed bytes, while trying to avoid
        making multiple reads from the underlying stream. Reads up to a
        buffer's worth of data if size is negative.

        Returns b"" if the file is at EOF.
        ''Write a bytes object to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, which is
        always the length of data in bytes. Note that due to buffering,
        the file on disk may not reflect the data written until close()
        is called.
        ''Change the file position.

        The new position is specified by offset, relative to the
        position indicated by whence. Possible values for whence are:

            0: start of stream (default): offset must not be negative
            1: current stream position
            2: end of stream; offset must not be positive

        Returns the new file position.

        Note that seeking is emulated, so depending on the parameters,
        this operation may be extremely slow.
        ''Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary or text mode.

    filename can be either an actual file name (given as a str, bytes,
    or PathLike object), in which case the named file is opened, or it
    can be an existing file object to read from or write to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb" (default), "w", "wb", "x", "xb",
    "a", or "ab" for binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt", or "at" for text
    mode.

    The format, check, preset and filters arguments specify the
    compression settings, as for LZMACompressor, LZMADecompressor and
    LZMAFile.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the LZMAFile
    constructor: LZMAFile(filename, mode, ...). In this case, the
    encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, an LZMAFile object is created, and wrapped in an
    io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
    handling behavior, and line ending(s).

    ''Compress a block of data.

    Refer to LZMACompressor's docstring for a description of the
    optional arguments *format*, *check*, *preset* and *filters*.

    For incremental compression, use an LZMACompressor instead.

''Basic message object for the email package object model.''EmailMessage''[ \(\)<>@,;:\\"/\[\]\?=]''Convenience function to format and return a key=value pair.

    This will quote the value if needed or if quote is true.  If value is a
    three tuple (charset, language, value), it will be encoded according
    to RFC2231 rules.  If it contains non-ascii characters it will likewise
    be encoded according to RFC2231 rules, using the utf-8 charset and
    a null language.
    ''encode_rfc2231''%s="%s"''Basic message object.

    A message object is defined as something that has a bunch of RFC 2822
    headers and a payload.  It may optionally have an envelope header
    (a.k.a. Unix-From or From_ header).  If the message is a container (i.e. a
    multipart or a message/rfc822), then the payload is a list of Message
    objects, otherwise it is a string.

    Message objects implement part of the `mapping' interface, which assumes
    there is exactly one occurrence of the header per message.  Some headers
    do in fact appear multiple times (e.g. Received) and for those headers,
    you must use the explicit API to set or get all the headers.  Not all of
    the mapping methods are implemented.
    ''text/plain''Return the entire formatted message as a string.
        ''Return the entire formatted message as a string.

        Optional 'unixfrom', when true, means include the Unix From_ envelope
        header.  For backward compatibility reasons, if maxheaderlen is
        not specified it defaults to 0, so you must override it explicitly
        if you want a different maxheaderlen.  'policy' is passed to the
        Generator instance used to serialize the message; if it is not
        specified the policy associated with the message instance is used.

        If the message object contains binary data that is not encoded
        according to RFC standards, the non-compliant data will be replaced by
        unicode "unknown character" code points.
        ''Return the entire formatted message as a bytes object.
        ''Return the entire formatted message as a bytes object.

        Optional 'unixfrom', when true, means include the Unix From_ envelope
        header.  'policy' is passed to the BytesGenerator instance used to
        serialize the message; if not specified the policy associated with
        the message instance is used.
        ''Return True if the message consists of multiple parts.''Add the given payload to the current payload.

        The current payload will always be a list of objects after this method
        is called.  If you want to set the payload to a scalar object, use
        set_payload() instead.
        ''Attach is not valid on a message with a non-multipart payload''Return a reference to the payload.

        The payload will either be a list object or a string.  If you mutate
        the list object, you modify the message's payload in place.  Optional
        i returns that index into the payload.

        Optional decode is a flag indicating whether the payload should be
        decoded or not, according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding header
        (default is False).

        When True and the message is not a multipart, the payload will be
        decoded if this header's value is `quoted-printable' or `base64'.  If
        some other encoding is used, or the header is missing, or if the
        payload has bogus data (i.e. bogus base64 or uuencoded data), the
        payload is returned as-is.

        If the message is a multipart and the decode flag is True, then None
        is returned.
        ''Expected list, got %s''x-uuencode''uuencode''uue''x-uue''Set the payload to the given value.

        Optional charset sets the message's default character set.  See
        set_charset() for details.
        ''Set the charset of the payload to a given character set.

        charset can be a Charset instance, a string naming a character set, or
        None.  If it is a string it will be converted to a Charset instance.
        If charset is None, the charset parameter will be removed from the
        Content-Type field.  Anything else will generate a TypeError.

        The message will be assumed to be of type text/* encoded with
        charset.input_charset.  It will be converted to charset.output_charset
        and encoded properly, if needed, when generating the plain text
        representation of the message.  MIME headers (MIME-Version,
        Content-Type, Content-Transfer-Encoding) will be added as needed.
        ''MIME-Version''Return the Charset instance associated with the message's payload.
        ''Return the total number of headers, including duplicates.''Get a header value.

        Return None if the header is missing instead of raising an exception.

        Note that if the header appeared multiple times, exactly which
        occurrence gets returned is undefined.  Use get_all() to get all
        the values matching a header field name.
        ''Set the value of a header.

        Note: this does not overwrite an existing header with the same field

        message, and may contain duplicates.  Any fields deleted and
        re-inserted are always appended to the header list.

        If no such fields exist, failobj is returned (defaults to None).
        ''Extended header setting.

        name is the header field to add.  keyword arguments can be used to set
        additional parameters for the header field, with underscores converted
        to dashes.  Normally the parameter will be added as key="value" unless
        value is None, in which case only the key will be added.  If a
        parameter value contains non-ASCII characters it can be specified as a
        three-tuple of (charset, language, value), in which case it will be
        encoded according to RFC2231 rules.  Otherwise it will be encoded using
        the utf-8 charset and a language of ''.

        Examples:

        msg.add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment', filename='bud.gif')
        msg.add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment',
                       filename=('utf-8', '', Fuballer.ppt'))
        msg.add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment',
                       filename='Fuballer.ppt'))
        ''Replace a header.

        Replace the first matching header found in the message, retaining
        header order and case.  If no matching header was found, a KeyError is
        raised.
        ''Return the message's content type.

        The returned string is coerced to lower case of the form
        `maintype/subtype'.  If there was no Content-Type header in the
        message, the default type as given by get_default_type() will be
        returned.  Since according to RFC 2045, messages always have a default
        type this will always return a value.

        RFC 2045 defines a message's default type to be text/plain unless it
        appears inside a multipart/digest container, in which case it would be
        message/rfc822.
        ''Return the message's main content type.

        This is the `maintype' part of the string returned by
        get_content_type().
        ''Returns the message's sub-content type.

        This is the `subtype' part of the string returned by
        get_content_type().
        ''Return the `default' content type.

        Most messages have a default content type of text/plain, except for
        messages that are subparts of multipart/digest containers.  Such
        subparts have a default content type of message/rfc822.
        ''Set the `default' content type.

        ctype should be either "text/plain" or "message/rfc822", although this
        is not enforced.  The default content type is not stored in the
        Content-Type header.
        ''decode_params''Return the message's Content-Type parameters, as a list.

        The elements of the returned list are 2-tuples of key/value pairs, as
        split on the `=' sign.  The left hand side of the `=' is the key,
        while the right hand side is the value.  If there is no `=' sign in
        the parameter the value is the empty string.  The value is as
        described in the get_param() method.

        Optional failobj is the object to return if there is no Content-Type
        header.  Optional header is the header to search instead of
        Content-Type.  If unquote is True, the value is unquoted.
        ''Return the parameter value if found in the Content-Type header.

        Optional failobj is the object to return if there is no Content-Type
        header, or the Content-Type header has no such parameter.  Optional
        header is the header to search instead of Content-Type.

        Parameter keys are always compared case insensitively.  The return
        value can either be a string, or a 3-tuple if the parameter was RFC
        2231 encoded.  When it's a 3-tuple, the elements of the value are of
        the form (CHARSET, LANGUAGE, VALUE).  Note that both CHARSET and
        LANGUAGE can be None, in which case you should consider VALUE to be
        encoded in the us-ascii charset.  You can usually ignore LANGUAGE.
        The parameter value (either the returned string, or the VALUE item in
        the 3-tuple) is always unquoted, unless unquote is set to False.

        If your application doesn't care whether the parameter was RFC 2231
        encoded, it can turn the return value into a string as follows:

            rawparam = msg.get_param('foo')
            param = email.utils.collapse_rfc2231_value(rawparam)

        ''Set a parameter in the Content-Type header.

        If the parameter already exists in the header, its value will be
        replaced with the new value.

        If header is Content-Type and has not yet been defined for this
        message, it will be set to "text/plain" and the new parameter and
        value will be appended as per RFC 2045.

        An alternate header can be specified in the header argument, and all
        parameters will be quoted as necessary unless requote is False.

        If charset is specified, the parameter will be encoded according to RFC
        2231.  Optional language specifies the RFC 2231 language, defaulting
        to the empty string.  Both charset and language should be strings.
        ''Remove the given parameter completely from the Content-Type header.

        The header will be re-written in place without the parameter or its
        value. All values will be quoted as necessary unless requote is
        False.  Optional header specifies an alternative to the Content-Type
        header.
        ''Set the main type and subtype for the Content-Type header.

        type must be a string in the form "maintype/subtype", otherwise a
        ValueError is raised.

        This method replaces the Content-Type header, keeping all the
        parameters in place.  If requote is False, this leaves the existing
        header's quoting as is.  Otherwise, the parameters will be quoted (the
        default).

        An alternative header can be specified in the header argument.  When
        the Content-Type header is set, we'll always also add a MIME-Version
        header.
        ''mime-version''Return the filename associated with the payload if present.

        The filename is extracted from the Content-Disposition header's
        `filename' parameter, and it is unquoted.  If that header is missing
        the `filename' parameter, this method falls back to looking for the
        `name' parameter.
        ''content-disposition''collapse_rfc2231_value''Return the boundary associated with the payload if present.

        The boundary is extracted from the Content-Type header's `boundary'
        parameter, and it is unquoted.
        ''Set the boundary parameter in Content-Type to 'boundary'.

        This is subtly different than deleting the Content-Type header and
        adding a new one with a new boundary parameter via add_header().  The
        main difference is that using the set_boundary() method preserves the
        order of the Content-Type header in the original message.

        HeaderParseError is raised if the message has no Content-Type header.
        ''No Content-Type header found''Return the charset parameter of the Content-Type header.

        The returned string is always coerced to lower case.  If there is no
        Content-Type header, or if that header has no charset parameter,
        failobj is returned.

        charset parameter for this message and all the subparts in its
        payload.

        Each item will either be a string (the value of the charset parameter
        in the Content-Type header of that part) or the value of the
        'failobj' parameter (defaults to None), if the part does not have a
        main MIME type of "text", or the charset is not defined.

        The list will contain one string for each part of the message, plus
        one for the container message (i.e. self), so that a non-multipart
        message will still return a list of length 1.

This module defines two useful functions:

guess_type(url, strict=True) -- guess the MIME type and encoding of a URL.

guess_extension(type, strict=True) -- guess the extension for a given MIME type.

It also contains the following, for tuning the behavior:

Data:

knownfiles -- list of files to parse
inited -- flag set when init() has been called
suffix_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to suffixes
encodings_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to encodings
types_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to types

Functions:

init([files]) -- parse a list of files, default knownfiles (on Windows, the
  default values are taken from the registry)
read_mime_types(file) -- parse one file, return a dictionary or None

Operator Interface

This module exports a set of functions corresponding to the intrinsic
operators of Python.  For example, operator.add(x, y) is equivalent
to the expression x+y.  The function names are those used for special
methods; variants without leading and trailing '__' are also provided
for convenience.

This is the pure Python implementation of the module.

    Return an estimate of the number of items in obj.
    This is useful for presizing containers when building from an iterable.

    If the object supports len(), the result will be exact. Otherwise, it may

    integer >= 0.

    Abstract base class for formatting option help.  OptionParser
    instances should use one of the HelpFormatter subclasses for
    formatting help; by default IndentedHelpFormatter is used.

    Instance attributes:
      parser : OptionParser
        the controlling OptionParser instance
      indent_increment : int
        the number of columns to indent per nesting level
      max_help_position : int
        the maximum starting column for option help text
      help_position : int
        the calculated starting column for option help text;
        initially the same as the maximum
      width : int
        total number of columns for output (pass None to constructor for
        this value to be taken from the $COLUMNS environment variable)
      level : int
        current indentation level
      current_indent : int
        current indentation level (in columns)
      help_width : int
        number of columns available for option help text (calculated)
      default_tag : str
        text to replace with each option's default value, "%default"
        by default.  Set to false value to disable default value expansion.
      option_strings : { Option : str }
        maps Option instances to the snippet of help text explaining
        the syntax of that option, e.g. "-h, --help" or
        "-fFILE, --file=FILE"
      _short_opt_fmt : str
        format string controlling how short options with values are
        printed in help text.  Must be either "%s%s" ("-fFILE") or
        "%s %s" ("-f FILE"), because those are the two syntaxes that
        Optik supports.
      _long_opt_fmt : str
        similar but for long options; must be either "%s %s" ("--file FILE")
        or "%s=%s" ("--file=FILE").
    ''COLUMNS''%default''invalid metavar delimiter for short options: %r''invalid metavar delimiter for long options: %r''dedent''subclasses must implement''

        Update the option values from an arbitrary dictionary, but only
        use keys from dict that already have a corresponding attribute
        in self.  Any keys in dict without a corresponding attribute
        are silently ignored.
        ''
        Update the option values from an arbitrary dictionary,
        using all keys from the dictionary regardless of whether
        they have a corresponding attribute in self or not.
        ''careful''loose''invalid update mode: %r''
    Abstract base class.

    Class attributes:
      standard_option_list : [Option]
        list of standard options that will be accepted by all instances
        of this parser class (intended to be overridden by subclasses).

    Instance attributes:
      option_list : [Option]
        the list of Option objects contained by this OptionContainer
      _short_opt : { string : Option }
        dictionary mapping short option strings, eg. "-f" or "-X",
        to the Option instances that implement them.  If an Option
        has multiple short option strings, it will appear in this
        dictionary multiple times. [1]
      _long_opt : { string : Option }
        dictionary mapping long option strings, eg. "--file" or
        "--exclude", to the Option instances that implement them.
        Again, a given Option can occur multiple times in this
        dictionary. [1]
      defaults : { string : any }
        dictionary mapping option destination names to default
        values for each destination [1]

    [1] These mappings are common to (shared by) all components of the
        controlling OptionParser, where they are initially created.

    Class attributes:
      standard_option_list : [Option]
        list of standard options that will be accepted by all instances
        of this parser class (intended to be overridden by subclasses).

    Instance attributes:
      usage : string
        a usage string for your program.  Before it is displayed
        to the user, "%prog" will be expanded to the name of
        your program (self.prog or os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])).
      prog : string
        the name of the current program (to override
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])).
      description : string
        A paragraph of text giving a brief overview of your program.
        optparse reformats this paragraph to fit the current terminal
        width and prints it when the user requests help (after usage,
        but before the list of options).
      epilog : string
        paragraph of help text to print after option help

      option_groups : [OptionGroup]
        list of option groups in this parser (option groups are
        irrelevant for parsing the command-line, but very useful
        for generating help)

      allow_interspersed_args : bool = true
        if true, positional arguments may be interspersed with options.
        Assuming -a and -b each take a single argument, the command-line
          -ablah foo bar -bboo baz
        will be interpreted the same as
          -ablah -bboo -- foo bar baz
        If this flag were false, that command line would be interpreted as
          -ablah -- foo bar -bboo baz
        -- ie. we stop processing options as soon as we see the first
        non-option argument.  (This is the tradition followed by
        Python's getopt module, Perl's Getopt::Std, and other argument-
        parsing libraries, but it is generally annoying to users.)

      process_default_values : bool = true
        if true, option default values are processed similarly to option
        values from the command line: that is, they are passed to the
        type-checking function for the option's type (as long as the
        default value is a string).  (This really only matters if you
        have defined custom types; see SF bug #955889.)  Set it to false
        to restore the behaviour of Optik 1.4.1 and earlier.

      rargs : [string]
        the argument list currently being parsed.  Only set when
        parse_args() is active, and continually trimmed down as
        we consume arguments.  Mainly there for the benefit of
        callback options.
      largs : [string]
        the list of leftover arguments that we have skipped while
        parsing options.  If allow_interspersed_args is false, this
        list is always empty.
      values : Values
        the set of option values currently being accumulated.  Only
        set when parse_args() is active.  Also mainly for callbacks.

    Because of the 'rargs', 'largs', and 'values' attributes,
    OptionParser is not thread-safe.  If, for some perverse reason, you
    need to parse command-line arguments simultaneously in different
    threads, use different OptionParser instances.

    ''
        Declare that you are done with this OptionParser.  This cleans up
        reference cycles so the OptionParser (and all objects referenced by
        it) can be garbage-collected promptly.  After calling destroy(), the
        OptionParser is unusable.
        ''--version''%prog [options]''Set parsing to not stop on the first non-option, allowing
        interspersing switches with command arguments. This is the
        default behavior. See also disable_interspersed_args() and the
        class documentation description of the attribute
        allow_interspersed_args.''Set parsing to stop on the first non-option. Use this if
        you have a command processor which runs another command that
        has options of its own and you want to make sure these options
        don't get confused.
        ''not an OptionGroup instance: %r''invalid OptionGroup (wrong parser)''
        parse_args(args : [string] = sys.argv[1:],
                   values : Values = None)
        -> (values : Values, args : [string])

        Parse the command-line options found in 'args' (default:
        sys.argv[1:]).  Any errors result in a call to 'error()', which
        by default prints the usage message to stderr and calls
        sys.exit() with an error message.  On success returns a pair
        (values, args) where 'values' is a Values instance (with all
        your option values) and 'args' is the list of arguments left
        over after parsing options.
        ''
        check_values(values : Values, args : [string])
        -> (values : Values, args : [string])

        Check that the supplied option values and leftover arguments are
        valid.  Returns the option values and leftover arguments
        (possibly adjusted, possibly completely new -- whatever you
        like).  Default implementation just returns the passed-in
        values; subclasses may override as desired.
        ''_process_args(largs : [string],
                         rargs : [string],
                         values : Values)

        Process command-line arguments and populate 'values', consuming
        options and arguments from 'rargs'.  If 'allow_interspersed_args' is
        false, stop at the first non-option argument.  If true, accumulate any
        interspersed non-option arguments in 'largs'.
        ''_match_long_opt(opt : string) -> string

        Determine which long option string 'opt' matches, ie. which one
        it is an unambiguous abbreviation for.  Raises BadOptionError if
        'opt' doesn't unambiguously match any long option string.
        ''%(option)s option requires %(number)d argument''%(option)s option requires %(number)d arguments''%s option does not take a value''%prog''error(msg : string)

        Print a usage message incorporating 'msg' to stderr and exit.
        If you override this in a subclass, it should not return -- it
        should either exit or raise an exception.
        ''%s: error: %s
''print_usage(file : file = stdout)

        Print the usage message for the current program (self.usage) to
        'file' (default stdout).  Any occurrence of the string "%prog" in
        self.usage is replaced with the name of the current program
        (basename of sys.argv[0]).  Does nothing if self.usage is empty
        or not defined.
        ''print_version(file : file = stdout)

        Print the version message for this program (self.version) to
        'file' (default stdout).  As with print_usage(), any occurrence
        of "%prog" in self.version is replaced by the current program's
        name.  Does nothing if self.version is empty or undefined.
        ''Options''print_help(file : file = stdout)

        Print an extended help message, listing all options and any
        help text provided with them, to 'file' (default stdout).
        ''_match_abbrev(s : string, wordmap : {string : Option}) -> string

    Return the string key in 'wordmap' for which 's' is an unambiguous
    abbreviation.  If 's' is found to be ambiguous or doesn't match any of
    'words', raise BadOptionError.
    ''OS routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on.

This exports:
  - all functions from posix or nt, e.g. unlink, stat, etc.
  - os.path is either posixpath or ntpath
  - os.name is either 'posix' or 'nt'
  - os.curdir is a string representing the current directory (always '.')
  - os.pardir is a string representing the parent directory (always '..')
  - os.sep is the (or a most common) pathname separator ('/' or '\\')
  - os.extsep is the extension separator (always '.')
  - os.altsep is the alternate pathname separator (None or '/')
  - os.pathsep is the component separator used in $PATH etc
  - os.linesep is the line separator in text files ('\r' or '\n' or '\r\n')
  - os.defpath is the default search path for executables
  - os.devnull is the file path of the null device ('/dev/null', etc.)

Programs that import and use 'os' stand a better chance of being
portable between different platforms.  Of course, they must then
only use functions that are defined by all platforms (e.g., unlink
and opendir), and leave all pathname manipulation to os.path
(e.g., split and join).

    Super-mkdir; create a leaf directory and all intermediate ones.  Works like
    mkdir, except that any intermediate path segment (not just the rightmost)
    will be created if it does not exist. If the target directory already
    exists, raise an OSError if exist_ok is False. Otherwise no exception is
    raised.  This is recursive.

    ''removedirs''removedirs(name)

    Super-rmdir; remove a leaf directory and all empty intermediate
    ones.  Works like rmdir except that, if the leaf directory is
    successfully removed, directories corresponding to rightmost path
    segments will be pruned away until either the whole path is
    consumed or an error occurs.  Errors during this latter phase are
    ignored -- they generally mean that a directory was not empty.

    ''renames''renames(old, new)

    Super-rename; create directories as necessary and delete any left
    empty.  Works like rename, except creation of any intermediate
    directories needed to make the new pathname good is attempted
    first.  After the rename, directories corresponding to rightmost
    path segments of the old name will be pruned until either the
    whole path is consumed or a nonempty directory is found.

    Note: this function can fail with the new directory structure made
    if you lack permissions needed to unlink the leaf directory or
    file.

    ''Directory tree generator.

    For each directory in the directory tree rooted at top (including top
    itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), yields a 3-tuple

        dirpath, dirnames, filenames

    dirpath is a string, the path to the directory.  dirnames is a list of
    the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (including symlinks to directories,
    and excluding '.' and '..').
    filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath.
    Note that the names in the lists are just names, with no path components.
    To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in
    dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).

    If optional arg 'topdown' is true or not specified, the triple for a
    directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories
    (directories are generated top down).  If topdown is false, the triple
    for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its
    subdirectories (directories are generated bottom up).

    When topdown is true, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place
    (e.g., via del or slice assignment), and walk will only recurse into the
    subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune the
    search, or to impose a specific order of visiting.  Modifying dirnames when
    topdown is false has no effect on the behavior of os.walk(), since the
    directories in dirnames have already been generated by the time dirnames
    itself is generated. No matter the value of topdown, the list of
    subdirectories is retrieved before the tuples for the directory and its
    subdirectories are generated.

    By default errors from the os.scandir() call are ignored.  If
    optional arg 'onerror' is specified, it should be a function; it
    will be called with one argument, an OSError instance.  It can
    report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception
    to abort the walk.  Note that the filename is available as the
    filename attribute of the exception object.

    By default, os.walk does not follow symbolic links to subdirectories on
    systems that support them.  In order to get this functionality, set the
    optional argument 'followlinks' to true.

    Caution:  if you pass a relative pathname for top, don't change the
    current working directory between resumptions of walk.  walk never
    changes the current directory, and assumes that the client doesn't
    either.

    Example:

    import os
    from os.path import join, getsize
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('python/Lib/email'):
        print(root, "consumes", end="")
        print(sum(getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files), end="")
        print("bytes in", len(files), "non-directory files")
        if 'CVS' in dirs:
            dirs.remove('CVS')  # don't visit CVS directories

    ''os.walk''fwalk''Directory tree generator.

        This behaves exactly like walk(), except that it yields a 4-tuple

            dirpath, dirnames, filenames, dirfd

        `dirpath`, `dirnames` and `filenames` are identical to walk() output,
        and `dirfd` is a file descriptor referring to the directory `dirpath`.

        The advantage of fwalk() over walk() is that it's safe against symlink
        races (when follow_symlinks is False).

        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
          and top should be relative; top will then be relative to that directory.
          (dir_fd is always supported for fwalk.)

        Caution:
        Since fwalk() yields file descriptors, those are only valid until the
        next iteration step, so you should dup() them if you want to keep them
        for a longer period.

        Example:

        import os
        for root, dirs, files, rootfd in os.fwalk('python/Lib/email'):
            print(root, "consumes", end="")
            print(sum(os.stat(name, dir_fd=rootfd).st_size for name in files),
                  end="")
            print("bytes in", len(files), "non-directory files")
            if 'CVS' in dirs:
                dirs.remove('CVS')  # don't visit CVS directories

''Exception to signal the parser is stuck.''%s: type=%r, value=%r, context=%r''Parser engine.

    The proper usage sequence is:

    p = Parser(grammar, [converter])  # create instance
    p.setup([start])                  # prepare for parsing
    <for each input token>:
        if p.addtoken(...):           # parse a token; may raise ParseError
            break
    root = p.rootnode                 # root of abstract syntax tree

    A Parser instance may be reused by calling setup() repeatedly.

    A Parser instance contains state pertaining to the current token
    sequence, and should not be used concurrently by different threads
    to parse separate token sequences.

    See driver.py for how to get input tokens by tokenizing a file or
    string.

    Parsing is complete when addtoken() returns True; the root of the
    abstract syntax tree can then be retrieved from the rootnode
    instance variable.  When a syntax error occurs, addtoken() raises
    the ParseError exception.  There is no error recovery; the parser
    cannot be used after a syntax error was reported (but it can be
    reinitialized by calling setup()).

    ''Constructor.

        The grammar argument is a grammar.Grammar instance; see the
        grammar module for more information.

        The parser is not ready yet for parsing; you must call the
        setup() method to get it started.

        The optional convert argument is a function mapping concrete
        syntax tree nodes to abstract syntax tree nodes.  If not
        given, no conversion is done and the syntax tree produced is
        the concrete syntax tree.  If given, it must be a function of
        two arguments, the first being the grammar (a grammar.Grammar
        instance), and the second being the concrete syntax tree node
        to be converted.  The syntax tree is converted from the bottom
        up.

        A concrete syntax tree node is a (type, value, context, nodes)
        tuple, where type is the node type (a token or symbol number),
        value is None for symbols and a string for tokens, context is
        None or an opaque value used for error reporting (typically a
        (lineno, offset) pair), and nodes is a list of children for
        symbols, and None for tokens.

        An abstract syntax tree node may be anything; this is entirely
        up to the converter function.

        ''Prepare for parsing.

        This *must* be called before starting to parse.

        The optional argument is an alternative start symbol; it
        defaults to the grammar's start symbol.

        You can use a Parser instance to parse any number of programs;
        each time you call setup() the parser is reset to an initial
        state determined by the (implicit or explicit) start symbol.

1995.

RFC 1738: "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)" by T. Berners-Lee, L. Masinter, M.
McCahill, December 1994

RFC 3986 is considered the current standard and any future changes to
urlparse module should conform with it.  The urlparse module is
currently not entirely compliant with this RFC due to defacto
scenarios for parsing, and for backward compatibility purposes, some
parsing quirks from older RFCs are retained. The testcases in
test_urlparse.py provides a good indicator of parsing behavior.

The WHATWG URL Parser spec should also be considered.  We are not compliant with
it either due to existing user code API behavior expectations (Hyrum's Law).
It serves as a useful guide when making changes.

    in the "safe" set (either the specified safe set, or default set).
    ''safe: bytes object.''%{:02X}''quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'

    Each part of a URL, e.g. the path info, the query, etc., has a
    different set of reserved characters that must be quoted. The
    quote function offers a cautious (not minimal) way to quote a
    string for most of these parts.

    RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax lists
    the following (un)reserved characters.

    unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
    reserved      = gen-delims / sub-delims
    gen-delims    = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
    sub-delims    = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                  / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

    Each of the reserved characters is reserved in some component of a URL,
    but not necessarily in all of them.

    The quote function %-escapes all characters that are neither in the
    unreserved chars ("always safe") nor the additional chars set via the
    safe arg.

    The default for the safe arg is '/'. The character is reserved, but in
    typical usage the quote function is being called on a path where the
    existing slash characters are to be preserved.

    Python 3.7 updates from using RFC 2396 to RFC 3986 to quote URL strings.
    Now, "~" is included in the set of unreserved characters.

    string and safe may be either str or bytes objects. encoding and errors
    must not be specified if string is a bytes object.

    The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to deal with
    non-ASCII characters, as accepted by the str.encode method.
    By default, encoding='utf-8' (characters are encoded with UTF-8), and
    errors='strict' (unsupported characters raise a UnicodeEncodeError).
    ''quote() doesn't support 'encoding' for bytes''quote() doesn't support 'errors' for bytes''Like quote(), but also replace ' ' with '+', as required for quoting
    HTML form values. Plus signs in the original string are escaped unless
    they are included in safe. It also does not have safe default to '/'.
    ''Like quote(), but accepts a bytes object rather than a str, and does
    not perform string-to-bytes encoding.  It always returns an ASCII string.
    quote_from_bytes(b'abc def?') -> 'abc%20def%3f'
    ''quote_from_bytes() expected bytes''Encode a dict or sequence of two-element tuples into a URL query string.

    If any values in the query arg are sequences and doseq is true, each
    sequence element is converted to a separate parameter.

    If the query arg is a sequence of two-element tuples, the order of the
    parameters in the output will match the order of parameters in the
    input.

    The components of a query arg may each be either a string or a bytes type.

    The safe, encoding, and errors parameters are passed down to the function
    specified by quote_via (encoding and errors only if a component is a str).

The Python Debugger Pdb
=======================

To use the debugger in its simplest form:

        >>> import pdb
        >>> pdb.run('<a statement>')

The debugger's prompt is '(Pdb) '.  This will stop in the first
function call in <a statement>.

Alternatively, if a statement terminated with an unhandled exception,
you can use pdb's post-mortem facility to inspect the contents of the
traceback:

        >>> <a statement>
        <exception traceback>
        >>> import pdb
        >>> pdb.pm()

The commands recognized by the debugger are listed in the next
section.  Most can be abbreviated as indicated; e.g., h(elp) means
that 'help' can be typed as 'h' or 'help' (but not as 'he' or 'hel',
nor as 'H' or 'Help' or 'HELP').  Optional arguments are enclosed in
square brackets.  Alternatives in the command syntax are separated
by a vertical bar (|).

A blank line repeats the previous command literally, except for
'list', where it lists the next 11 lines.

Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python
statements and are executed in the context of the program being
debugged.  Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation
point ('!').  This is a powerful way to inspect the program being
debugged; it is even possible to change variables or call functions.
When an exception occurs in such a statement, the exception name is
printed but the debugger's state is not changed.

The debugger supports aliases, which can save typing.  And aliases can
have parameters (see the alias help entry) which allows one a certain
level of adaptability to the context under examination.

Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by the
pair ';;'.  No intelligence is applied to separating the commands; the
input is split at the first ';;', even if it is in the middle of a
quoted string.

If a file ".pdbrc" exists in your home directory or in the current
directory, it is read in and executed as if it had been typed at the
debugger prompt.  This is particularly useful for aliases.  If both
files exist, the one in the home directory is read first and aliases
defined there can be overridden by the local file.  This behavior can be
disabled by passing the "readrc=False" argument to the Pdb constructor.

Aside from aliases, the debugger is not directly programmable; but it
is implemented as a class from which you can derive your own debugger
class, which you can make as fancy as you like.

        (com) ...
        (com) end
        (Pdb)

        Specify a list of commands for breakpoint number bpnumber.
        The commands themselves are entered on the following lines.
        Type a line containing just 'end' to terminate the commands.
        The commands are executed when the breakpoint is hit.

        To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type commands and
        follow it immediately with end; that is, give no commands.

        With no bpnumber argument, commands refers to the last
        breakpoint set.

        You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up
        again.  Simply use the continue command, or step, or any other
        command that resumes execution.

        Specifying any command resuming execution (currently continue,
        step, next, return, jump, quit and their abbreviations)
        terminates the command list (as if that command was
        immediately followed by end).  This is because any time you
        resume execution (even with a simple next or step), you may
        encounter another breakpoint -- which could have its own
        command list, leading to ambiguities about which list to
        execute.

        If you use the 'silent' command in the command list, the usual
        message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This
        may be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific
        message and then continue.  If none of the other commands
        print anything, you will see no sign that the breakpoint was
        reached.

        Without argument, list all breaks.

        With a line number argument, set a break at this line in the
        current file.  With a function name, set a break at the first
        executable line of that function.  If a second argument is
        present, it is a string specifying an expression which must
        evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

        The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon,
        to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that
        hasn't been loaded yet).  The file is searched for on
        sys.path; the .py suffix may be omitted.

        Enables the breakpoints given as a space separated list of

        ''Enabled %s''disable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]
        Disables the breakpoints given as a space separated list of
        breakpoint numbers.  Disabling a breakpoint means it cannot
        cause the program to stop execution, but unlike clearing a
        breakpoint, it remains in the list of breakpoints and can be
        (re-)enabled.
        ''Disabled %s''condition bpnumber [condition]
        Set a new condition for the breakpoint, an expression which
        must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.  If
        condition is absent, any existing condition is removed; i.e.,
        the breakpoint is made unconditional.
        ''Breakpoint %d is now unconditional.''New condition set for breakpoint %d.''ignore bpnumber [count]
        Set the ignore count for the given breakpoint number.  If
        count is omitted, the ignore count is set to 0.  A breakpoint
        becomes active when the ignore count is zero.  When non-zero,
        the count is decremented each time the breakpoint is reached
        and the breakpoint is not disabled and any associated
        condition evaluates to true.

        are then hidden until the alias is removed.  Aliasing is
        recursively applied to the first word of the command line; all
        other words in the line are left alone.

        As an example, here are two useful aliases (especially when
        placed in the .pdbrc file):

        # Print instance variables (usage "pi classInst")
        alias pi for k in %1.__dict__.keys(): print("%1.",k,"=",%1.__dict__[k])
        # Print instance variables in self

        Delete the specified alias.

        assign to a global variable you must always prefix the command
        with a 'global' command, e.g.:

    ''This takes a binary file for writing a pickle data stream.

        The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the
        given protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
        The default protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and
        is incompatible with previous versions.

        Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest
        protocol version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the
        more recent the version of Python needed to read the pickle
        produced.

        The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a
        single bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for
        binary writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom
        object that meets this interface.

        If *fix_imports* is True and *protocol* is less than 3, pickle
        will try to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names
        used in Python 2, so that the pickle data stream is readable
        with Python 2.

        If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
        serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

        If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
        of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
        (such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
        buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

        It is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*
        is None or smaller than 5.
        ''pickle protocol must be <= %d''buffer_callback needs protocol >= 5''_file_write''file must have a 'write' attribute''Clears the pickler's "memo".

        The memo is the data structure that remembers which objects the
        pickler has already seen, so that shared or recursive objects
        are pickled by reference and not by value.  This method is
        useful when re-using picklers.

        The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so
        no proto argument is needed.

        The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that
        takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires
        no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file*
        can be a binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO
        object, or any other custom object that meets this interface.

        The file-like object must have two methods, a read() method
        that takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that
        requires no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.
        Thus file-like object can be a binary file object opened for
        reading, a BytesIO object, or any other custom object that
        meets this interface.

        If *buffers* is not None, it should be an iterable of buffer-enabled
        objects that is consumed each time the pickle stream references
        an out-of-band buffer view.  Such buffers have been given in order
        to the *buffer_callback* of a Pickler object.

        If *buffers* is None (the default), then the buffers are taken
        from the pickle stream, assuming they are serialized there.
        It is an error for *buffers* to be None if the pickle stream
        was produced with a non-None *buffer_callback*.

        Other optional arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and
        *errors*, which are used to control compatibility support for
        pickle stream generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True,
        pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names
        used in Python 3.  The *encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how
        to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python 2; these
        default to 'ASCII' and 'strict', respectively. *encoding* can be
        'bytes' to read these 8-bit string instances as bytes objects.

    'path' should be either None or a list of paths to look for
    modules in.

    'prefix' is a string to output on the front of every module name
    on output.

    Note that this function must import all *packages* (NOT all
    modules!) on the given path, in order to access the __path__
    attribute to find submodules.

    'onerror' is a function which gets called with one argument (the
    name of the package which was being imported) if any exception
    occurs while trying to import a package.  If no onerror function is
    supplied, ImportErrors are caught and ignored, while all other
    exceptions are propagated, terminating the search.

    Examples:

    ImpImporter(dirname) produces a PEP 302 finder that searches that
    directory.  ImpImporter(None) produces a PEP 302 finder that searches
    the current sys.path, plus any modules that are frozen or built-in.

    Note that ImpImporter does not currently support being used by placement
    on sys.meta_path.
    ''This emulation is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.12; use 'importlib' instead''PEP 302 Loader that wraps Python's "classic" import algorithm
    ''Loader for module %s cannot handle module %s''zipimport''zipimporter''Retrieve a finder for the given path item

    The returned finder is cached in sys.path_importer_cache
    if it was newly created by a path hook.

    The cache (or part of it) can be cleared manually if a
    rescan of sys.path_hooks is necessary.
    ''Yield finders for the given module name

    If fullname contains a '.', the finders will be for the package
    containing fullname, otherwise they will be all registered top level
    finders (i.e. those on both sys.meta_path and sys.path_hooks).

    If the named module is in a package, that package is imported as a side
    effect of invoking this function.

    If no module name is specified, all top level finders are produced.
    ''Relative module name {!r} not supported''pkg''Get a "loader" object for module_or_name

    Returns None if the module cannot be found or imported.
    If the named module is not already imported, its containing package
    (if any) is imported, in order to establish the package __path__.
    ''Find a "loader" object for fullname

    This is a backwards compatibility wrapper around
    importlib.util.find_spec that converts most failures to ImportError
    and only returns the loader rather than the full spec
    ''Error while finding loader for {!r} ({}: {})''Extend a package's path.

    Intended use is to place the following code in a package's __init__.py:

        from pkgutil import extend_path
        __path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)

    This will add to the package's __path__ all subdirectories of
    directories on sys.path named after the package.  This is useful
    if one wants to distribute different parts of a single logical
    package as multiple directories.

    It also looks for *.pkg files beginning where * matches the name
    argument.  This feature is similar to *.pth files (see site.py),
    except that it doesn't special-case lines starting with 'import'.
    A *.pkg file is trusted at face value: apart from checking for
    duplicates, all entries found in a *.pkg file are added to the
    path, regardless of whether they are exist the filesystem.  (This
    is a feature.)

    If the input path is not a list (as is the case for frozen
    packages) it is returned unchanged.  The input path is not
    modified; an extended copy is returned.  Items are only appended
    to the copy at the end.

    It is assumed that sys.path is a sequence.  Items of sys.path that
    are not (unicode or 8-bit) strings referring to existing
    directories are ignored.  Unicode items of sys.path that cause
    errors when used as filenames may cause this function to raise an
    exception (in line with os.path.isdir() behavior).
    ''.pkg''Can't open %s: %s
''Get a resource from a package.

    This is a wrapper round the PEP 302 loader get_data API. The package
    argument should be the name of a package, in standard module format
    (foo.bar). The resource argument should be in the form of a relative
    filename, using '/' as the path separator. The parent directory name '..'
    is not allowed, and nor is a rooted name (starting with a '/').

    The function returns a binary string, which is the contents of the
    specified resource.

    For packages located in the filesystem, which have already been imported,
    this is the rough equivalent of

        d = os.path.dirname(sys.modules[package].__file__)
        data = open(os.path.join(d, resource), 'rb').read()

    If the package cannot be located or loaded, or it uses a PEP 302 loader
    which does not support get_data(), then None is returned.
    ''
    Resolve a name to an object.

    It is expected that `name` will be a string in one of the following
    formats, where W is shorthand for a valid Python identifier and dot stands
    for a literal period in these pseudo-regexes:

    W(.W)*
    W(.W)*:(W(.W)*)?

    The first form is intended for backward compatibility only. It assumes that
    some part of the dotted name is a package, and the rest is an object
    somewhere within that package, possibly nested inside other objects.
    Because the place where the package stops and the object hierarchy starts
    can't be inferred by inspection, repeated attempts to import must be done
    with this form.

    In the second form, the caller makes the division point clear through the
    provision of a single colon: the dotted name to the left of the colon is a
    package to be imported, and the dotted name to the right is the object
    hierarchy within that package. Only one import is needed in this form. If
    it ends with the colon, then a module object is returned.

    The function will return an object (which might be a module), or raise one
    of the following exceptions:

    ValueError - if `name` isn't in a recognised format
    ImportError - if an import failed when it shouldn't have
    AttributeError - if a failure occurred when traversing the object hierarchy
                     within the imported package to get to the desired object.
    ''(?!\d)(\w+)(\.(?!\d)(\w+))*''^(?P<pkg>'')(?P<cln>:(?P<obj>'')?)?$''invalid format: ''cln'' This module tries to retrieve as much platform-identifying data as
    possible. It makes this information available via function APIs.

    If called from the command line, it prints the platform
    information concatenated as single string to stdout. The output
    format is useable as part of a filename.

        Returns a tuple of strings (lib,version) which default to the
        given parameters in case the lookup fails.

        Note that the function has intimate knowledge of how different
        libc versions add symbols to the executable and thus is probably
        only useable for executables compiled using gcc.

        The file is read and scanned in chunks of chunksize bytes.

    '' Interface to the system's file command.

        The function uses the -b option of the file command to have it
        omit the filename in its output. Follow the symlinks. It returns
        default in case the command should fail.

    ''WindowsPE''MSDOS'' Queries the given executable (defaults to the Python interpreter
        binary) for various architecture information.

        Returns a tuple (bits, linkage) which contains information about
        the bit architecture and the linkage format used for the
        executable. Both values are returned as strings.

        Values that cannot be determined are returned as given by the
        parameter presets. If bits is given as '', the sizeof(pointer)
        (or sizeof(long) on Python version < 1.5.2) is used as
        indicator for the supported pointer size.

        The function relies on the system's "file" command to do the
        actual work. This is available on most if not all Unix
        platforms. On some non-Unix platforms where the "file" command
        does not exist and the executable is set to the Python interpreter
        binary defaults from _default_architecture are used.

        An empty string is returned if the value cannot be

        e.g.  NetBSD does this.

Returns a parsed version of Python's sys.version as tuple
        (name, version, branch, revision, buildno, builddate, compiler)
        referring to the Python implementation name, version, branch,
        revision, build number, build date/time as string and the compiler
        identification string.

        Note that unlike the Python sys.version, the returned value
        for the Python version will always include the patchlevel (it
        defaults to '.0').

        The function returns empty strings for tuple entries that
        cannot be determined.

        sys_version may be given to parse an alternative version
        string, e.g. if the version was read from a different Python

    '' Returns a string identifying the compiler used for compiling
        Python.

    ''terse'' Returns a single string identifying the underlying platform

        The output is intended to be human readable rather than
        machine parseable. It may look different on different
        platforms and this is intended.

        If "aliased" is true, the function will use aliases for
        various platforms that report system names which differ from
        their common names, e.g. SunOS will be reported as
        Solaris. The system_alias() function is used to implement
        this.

        Setting terse to true causes the function to return only the
        absolute minimum information needed to identify the platform.

    ''Unable to read files ''--terse''nonaliased''--nonaliased''plistlib.py -- a tool to generate and parse MacOSX .plist files.

The property list (.plist) file format is a simple XML pickle supporting
basic object types, like dictionaries, lists, numbers and strings.
Usually the top level object is a dictionary.

To write out a plist file, use the dump(value, file)
function. 'value' is the top level object, 'file' is
a (writable) file object.

To parse a plist from a file, use the load(file) function,
with a (readable) file object as the only argument. It
returns the top level object (again, usually a dictionary).

To work with plist data in bytes objects, you can use loads()
and dumps().

Values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, tuples, lists,
dictionaries (but only with string keys), Data, bytes, bytearray, or
datetime.datetime objects.

Generate Plist example:

    import datetime
    import plistlib

    pl = dict(
        aString = "Doodah",
        aList = ["A", "B", 12, 32.1, [1, 2, 3]],
        aFloat = 0.1,
        anInt = 728,
        aDict = dict(
            anotherString = "<hello & hi there!>",
            aThirdString = "M\xe4ssig, Ma\xdf",
            aTrueValue = True,
            aFalseValue = False,
        ),
        someData = b"<binary gunk>",
        someMoreData = b"<lots of binary gunk>" * 10,
        aDate = datetime.datetime.now()
    )
    print(plistlib.dumps(pl).decode())

Parse Plist example:

    import plistlib

    plist = b'''<plist version="1.0">

- adds the id of the _WorkItem to the "Work Ids" queue

Local worker thread:

  WorkItem from the "Work Items" dict: if the work item has been cancelled then
  it is simply removed from the dict, otherwise it is repackaged as a
  _CallItem and put in the "Call Q". New _CallItems are put in the "Call Q"
  until "Call Q" is full. NOTE: the size of the "Call Q" is kept small because
  calls placed in the "Call Q" can no longer be cancelled with Future.cancel().

        ''chunksize must be >= 1.''Abstract Protocol base classes.''DatagramProtocol''SubprocessProtocol''Common base class for protocol interfaces.

    Usually user implements protocols that derived from BaseProtocol
    like Protocol or ProcessProtocol.

    The only case when BaseProtocol should be implemented directly is
    write-only transport like write pipe
    ''Called when a connection is made.

        The argument is the transport representing the pipe connection.
        To receive data, wait for data_received() calls.
        When the connection is closed, connection_lost() is called.
        ''Called when the connection is lost or closed.

        The argument is an exception object or None (the latter
        meaning a regular EOF is received or the connection was
        aborted or closed).
        ''Called when the transport's buffer goes over the high-water mark.

        Pause and resume calls are paired -- pause_writing() is called
        once when the buffer goes strictly over the high-water mark
        (even if subsequent writes increases the buffer size even
        more), and eventually resume_writing() is called once when the
        buffer size reaches the low-water mark.

        Note that if the buffer size equals the high-water mark,
        pause_writing() is not called -- it must go strictly over.
        Conversely, resume_writing() is called when the buffer size is
        equal or lower than the low-water mark.  These end conditions
        are important to ensure that things go as expected when either
        mark is zero.

        NOTE: This is the only Protocol callback that is not called
        through EventLoop.call_soon() -- if it were, it would have no
        effect when it's most needed (when the app keeps writing
        without yielding until pause_writing() is called).
        ''Called when the transport's buffer drains below the low-water mark.

        See pause_writing() for details.
        ''Interface for stream protocol.

    The user should implement this interface.  They can inherit from
    this class but don't need to.  The implementations here do
    nothing (they don't raise exceptions).

    When the user wants to requests a transport, they pass a protocol
    factory to a utility function (e.g., EventLoop.create_connection()).

    When the connection is made successfully, connection_made() is
    called with a suitable transport object.  Then data_received()
    will be called 0 or more times with data (bytes) received from the
    transport; finally, connection_lost() will be called exactly once
    with either an exception object or None as an argument.

    State machine of calls:

      start -> CM [-> DR*] [-> ER?] -> CL -> end

    * CM: connection_made()
    * DR: data_received()
    * ER: eof_received()
    * CL: connection_lost()
    ''Called when some data is received.

        The argument is a bytes object.
        ''Called when the other end calls write_eof() or equivalent.

        If this returns a false value (including None), the transport
        will close itself.  If it returns a true value, closing the
        transport is up to the protocol.
        ''Interface for stream protocol with manual buffer control.

    Event methods, such as `create_server` and `create_connection`,
    accept factories that return protocols that implement this interface.

    The idea of BufferedProtocol is that it allows to manually allocate
    and control the receive buffer.  Event loops can then use the buffer
    provided by the protocol to avoid unnecessary data copies.  This
    can result in noticeable performance improvement for protocols that
    receive big amounts of data.  Sophisticated protocols can allocate
    the buffer only once at creation time.

    State machine of calls:

      start -> CM [-> GB [-> BU?]]* [-> ER?] -> CL -> end

    * CM: connection_made()
    * GB: get_buffer()
    * BU: buffer_updated()
    * ER: eof_received()
    * CL: connection_lost()
    ''Called to allocate a new receive buffer.

        It is an error to return a zero-sized buffer.

    compile the file.

    To raise this exception, use

        raise PyCompileError(exc_type,exc_value,file[,msg])

    where

        exc_type:   exception type to be used in error message
                    type name can be accesses as class variable
                    'exc_type_name'

        exc_value:  exception value to be used in error message
                    can be accesses as class variable 'exc_value'

        file:       name of file being compiled to be used in error message
                    can be accesses as class variable 'file'

        msg:        string message to be written as error message
                    If no value is given, a default exception message will be
                    given, consistent with 'standard' py_compile output.

    ''File "<string>"''File "%s"''Sorry: %s: %s''SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH''Byte-compile one Python source file to Python bytecode.

    :param file: The source file name.
    :param cfile: The target byte compiled file name.  When not given, this
        defaults to the PEP 3147/PEP 488 location.
    :param dfile: Purported file name, i.e. the file name that shows up in
        error messages.  Defaults to the source file name.
    :param doraise: Flag indicating whether or not an exception should be
        raised when a compile error is found.  If an exception occurs and this
        flag is set to False, a string indicating the nature of the exception
        will be printed, and the function will return to the caller. If an
        exception occurs and this flag is set to True, a PyCompileError
        exception will be raised.
    :param optimize: The optimization level for the compiler.  Valid values
        are -1, 0, 1 and 2.  A value of -1 means to use the optimization
        level of the current interpreter, as given by -O command line options.
    :param invalidation_mode:
    :param quiet: Return full output with False or 0, errors only with 1,
        and no output with 2.

    :return: Path to the resulting byte compiled file.

    Note that it isn't necessary to byte-compile Python modules for
    execution efficiency -- Python itself byte-compiles a module when
    it is loaded, and if it can, writes out the bytecode to the
    corresponding .pyc file.

    However, if a Python installation is shared between users, it is a
    good idea to byte-compile all modules upon installation, since
    other users may not be able to write in the source directories,
    and thus they won't be able to write the .pyc file, and then
    they would be byte-compiling every module each time it is loaded.
    This can slow down program start-up considerably.

    See compileall.py for a script/module that uses this module to
    byte-compile all installed files (or all files in selected
    directories).

    Do note that FileExistsError is raised if cfile ends up pointing at a
    non-regular file or symlink. Because the compilation uses a file renaming,
    the resulting file would be regular and thus not the same type of file as
    it was previously.

At the Python interactive prompt, calling help(thing) on a Python object
documents the object, and calling help() starts up an interactive
help session.

Or, at the shell command line outside of Python:

Run "pydoc <name>" to show documentation on something.  <name> may be
the name of a function, module, package, or a dotted reference to a
class or function within a module or module in a package.  If the
argument contains a path segment delimiter (e.g. slash on Unix,
backslash on Windows) it is treated as the path to a Python source file.

Run "pydoc -k <keyword>" to search for a keyword in the synopsis lines
of all available modules.

Run "pydoc -n <hostname>" to start an HTTP server with the given
hostname (default: localhost) on the local machine.

Run "pydoc -p <port>" to start an HTTP server on the given port on the
local machine.  Port number 0 can be used to get an arbitrary unused port.

Run "pydoc -b" to start an HTTP server on an arbitrary unused port and
open a web browser to interactively browse documentation.  Combine with
the -n and -p options to control the hostname and port used.

Run "pydoc -w <name>" to write out the HTML documentation for a module
to a file named "<name>.html".

    Start an HTML/text server thread, so HTML or text documents can be
    browsed dynamically and interactively with a web browser.  Example use:

        >>> import time
        >>> import pydoc

        Define a URL handler.  To determine what the client is asking
        for, check the URL and content_type.

        Then get or generate some text or HTML code and return it.

        >>> def my_url_handler(url, content_type):
        ...     text = 'the URL sent was: (%s, %s)' % (url, content_type)
        ...     return text

        Start server thread on port 0.
        If you use port 0, the server will pick a random port number.
        You can then use serverthread.port to get the port number.

        >>> port = 0
        >>> serverthread = pydoc._start_server(my_url_handler, port)

        Check that the server is really started.  If it is, open browser
        and get first page.  Use serverthread.url as the starting page.

        >>> if serverthread.serving:
        ...    import webbrowser

        The next two lines are commented out so a browser doesn't open if
        doctest is run on this module.

        #...    webbrowser.open(serverthread.url)
        #True

        Let the server do its thing. We just need to monitor its status.
        Use time.sleep so the loop doesn't hog the CPU.

        >>> starttime = time.monotonic()
        >>> timeout = 1                    #seconds

        This is a short timeout for testing purposes.

        >>> while serverthread.serving:

''
    Abstract base class for Node and Leaf.

    This provides some default functionality and boilerplate using the
    template pattern.

    A node may be a subnode of at most one parent.
    ''Constructor that prevents Base from being instantiated.''Cannot instantiate Base''
        Compare two nodes for equality.

        This calls the method _eq().
        ''
        Compare two nodes for equality.

        This is called by __eq__ and __ne__.  It is only called if the two nodes
        have the same type.  This must be implemented by the concrete subclass.
        Nodes should be considered equal if they have the same structure,
        ignoring the prefix string and other context information.

        Initializer.

        Takes a type constant (a symbol number >= 256), a sequence of
        child nodes, and an optional context keyword argument.

        As a side effect, the parent pointers of the children are updated.

    ''
    A pattern is a tree matching pattern.

    It looks for a specific node type (token or symbol), and
    optionally for a specific content.

    This is an abstract base class.  There are three concrete
    subclasses:

    - LeafPattern matches a single leaf node;
    - NodePattern matches a single node (usually non-leaf);
    - WildcardPattern matches a sequence of nodes of variable length.
    ''Constructor that prevents BasePattern from being instantiated.''Cannot instantiate BasePattern''
        A subclass can define this as a hook for optimizations.

        Returns either self or another node with the same effect.
        ''
        Does this pattern exactly match a node?

        Returns True if it matches, False if not.

        If results is not None, it must be a dict which will be
        updated with the nodes matching named subpatterns.

        Default implementation for non-wildcard patterns.

        Generator yielding all matches for this pattern.

        Default implementation for non-wildcard patterns.
        ''
        Initializer.  Takes optional type, content, and name.

        The type, if given must be a token type (< 256).  If not given,
        this matches any *leaf* node; the content may still be required.

        The content, if given, must be a string.

        If a name is given, the matching node is stored in the results
        dict under that key.
        ''Override match() to insist on a leaf node.''
        Match the pattern's content to the node's children.

        This assumes the node type matches and self.content is not None.

        Returns True if it matches, False if not.

        If results is not None, it must be a dict which will be
        updated with the nodes matching named subpatterns.

        When returning False, the results dict may still be updated.
        ''
        Initializer.  Takes optional type, content, and name.

        The type, if given, must be a symbol type (>= 256).  If the
        type is None this matches *any* single node (leaf or not),
        except if content is not None, in which it only matches
        non-leaf nodes that also match the content pattern.

        The content, if not None, must be a sequence of Patterns that
        must match the node's children exactly.  If the content is
        given, the type must not be None.

        If a name is given, the matching node is stored in the results
        dict under that key.
        ''
    A wildcard pattern can match zero or more nodes.

    This has all the flexibility needed to implement patterns like:

    .*      .+      .?      .{m,n}
    (a b c | d e | f)
    (...)*  (...)+  (...)?  (...){m,n}

    except it always uses non-greedy matching.
    ''
        Initializer.

        Args:
            content: optional sequence of subsequences of patterns;
                     if absent, matches one node;
                     if present, each subsequence is an alternative [*]
            min: optional minimum number of times to match, default 0
            max: optional maximum number of times to match, default HUGE
            name: optional name assigned to this match

        [*] Thus, if content is [[a, b, c], [d, e], [f, g, h]] this is
            equivalent to (a b c | d e | f g h); if content is None,
            this is equivalent to '.' in regular expression terms.
            The min and max parameters work as follows:
                min=0, max=maxint: .*
                min=1, max=maxint: .+
                min=0, max=1: .?
                min=1, max=1: .
            If content is not None, replace the dot with the parenthesized
            list of alternatives, e.g. (a b c | d e | f g h)*

''Quoted-printable content transfer encoding per RFCs 2045-2047.

This module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045
to encode US ASCII-like 8-bit data called `quoted-printable'.  It is used to
safely encode text that is in a character set similar to the 7-bit US ASCII
character set, but that includes some 8-bit characters that are normally not
allowed in email bodies or headers.

Quoted-printable is very space-inefficient for encoding binary files; use the
email.base64mime module for that instead.

This module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies
with quoted-printable encoding.

RFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an
`encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names
in To:/From:/Cc: etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.

This module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character
conversion necessary for proper internationalized headers; it only
does dumb encoding and decoding.  To deal with the various line
wrapping issues, use the email.header module.

    used specifically for email header fields to allow charsets with mostly 7
    bit characters (and some 8 bit) to remain more or less readable in non-RFC
    2045 aware mail clients.

    Each line will be wrapped at, at most, maxlinelen characters before the
    eol string (maxlinelen defaults to 76 characters, the maximum value
    permitted by RFC 2045).  Long lines will have the 'soft line break'
    quoted-printable character "=" appended to them, so the decoded text will
    be identical to the original text.

    The minimum maxlinelen is 4 to have room for a quoted character ("=XX")

General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:

* The period is 2**19937-1.
* It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
* The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
  and is, therefore, threadsafe.

    Used to instantiate instances of Random to get generators that don't
    share state.

    Class Random can also be subclassed if you want to use a different basic
    generator of your own devising: in that case, override the following
    methods:  random(), seed(), getstate(), and setstate().
    Optionally, implement a getrandbits() method so that randrange()
    can cover arbitrarily large ranges.

    ''Initialize an instance.

        Optional argument x controls seeding, as for Random.seed().
        ''Initialize internal state from a seed.

        The only supported seed types are None, int, float,
        str, bytes, and bytearray.

        None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
        system specific randomness source if available.

        If *a* is an int, all bits are used.

        For version 2 (the default), all of the bits are used if *a* is a str,
        bytes, or bytearray.  For version 1 (provided for reproducing random
        sequences from older versions of Python), the algorithm for str and
        bytes generates a narrower range of seeds.

        ''Seeding based on hashing is deprecated
since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version. The only 
supported seed types are: None, int, float, str, bytes, and bytearray.''Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.''Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().''state with version %s passed to Random.setstate() of version %s''Control how subclasses generate random integers.

        The algorithm a subclass can use depends on the random() and/or
        getrandbits() implementation available to it and determines
        whether it can generate random integers from arbitrarily large
        ranges.
        ''_randbelow''Return a random int in the range [0,n).  Returns 0 if n==0.''Return a random int in the range [0,n).  Returns 0 if n==0.

        The implementation does not use getrandbits, but only random.
        ''Underlying random() generator does not supply 
enough bits to choose from a population range this large.
To remove the range limitation, add a getrandbits() method.''Generate n random bytes.''Choose a random item from range(start, stop[, step]).

        This fixes the problem with randint() which includes the
        endpoint; in Python this is usually not what you want.

        ''randrange() will raise TypeError in the future''non-integer arg 1 for randrange()''non-integer arguments to randrange() have been deprecated since Python 3.10 and will be removed in a subsequent version''Missing a non-None stop argument''empty range for randrange()''non-integer stop for randrange()''non-integer step for randrange()''empty range for randrange() (%d, %d, %d)''zero step for randrange()''Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
        ''Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.''Shuffle list x in place, and return None.

        Optional argument random is a 0-argument function returning a
        random float in [0.0, 1.0); if it is the default None, the
        standard random.random will be used.

        ''The *random* parameter to shuffle() has been deprecated
since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version.''Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence or set.

        Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
        leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
        in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
        samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
        into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).

        Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
        population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
        selection in the sample.

        Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional
        counts parameter.  For example:

            sample(['red', 'blue'], counts=[4, 2], k=5)

        is equivalent to:

            sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'blue', 'blue'], k=5)

        To choose a sample from a range of integers, use range() for the
        population argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient
        for sampling from a large population:

            sample(range(10000000), 60)

since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version.''Population must be a sequence.

        Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
        and having a given mode value in-between.

        ''Normal distribution.

        mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.

        ''Gaussian distribution.

        mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
        slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.

        Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.

        ''Log normal distribution.

        If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
        normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
        mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.

        ''Exponential distribution.

        lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
        nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
        a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
        positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
        infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.

        ''Circular data distribution.

        mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
        kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or

''Support for regular expressions (RE).

This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to
those found in Perl.  It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both
the pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and
characters outside the US ASCII range.

Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.
Most ordinary characters, like "A", "a", or "0", are the simplest
regular expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can
concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.

The special characters are:
    "."      Matches any character except a newline.
    "^"      Matches the start of the string.
    "$"      Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at
             the end of the string.
    "*"      Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
             Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.
    "+"      Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
    "?"      Matches 0 or 1 (greedy) of the preceding RE.
    *?,+?,?? Non-greedy versions of the previous three special characters.
    {m,n}    Matches from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE.
    {m,n}?   Non-greedy version of the above.
    "\\"     Either escapes special characters or signals a special sequence.
    []       Indicates a set of characters.
             A "^" as the first character indicates a complementing set.
    "|"      A|B, creates an RE that will match either A or B.
    (...)    Matches the RE inside the parentheses.
             The contents can be retrieved or matched later in the string.
    (?aiLmsux) The letters set the corresponding flags defined below.
    (?:...)  Non-grouping version of regular parentheses.
    (?P<name>...) The substring matched by the group is accessible by name.
    (?P=name)     Matches the text matched earlier by the group named name.
    (?#...)  A comment; ignored.
    (?=...)  Matches if ... matches next, but doesn't consume the string.
    (?!...)  Matches if ... doesn't match next.
    (?<=...) Matches if preceded by ... (must be fixed length).
    (?<!...) Matches if not preceded by ... (must be fixed length).
    (?(id/name)yes|no) Matches yes pattern if the group with id/name matched,
                       the (optional) no pattern otherwise.

The special sequences consist of "\\" and a character from the list
below.  If the ordinary character is not on the list, then the
resulting RE will match the second character.
    \number  Matches the contents of the group of the same number.
    \A       Matches only at the start of the string.
    \Z       Matches only at the end of the string.
    \b       Matches the empty string, but only at the start or end of a word.
    \B       Matches the empty string, but not at the start or end of a word.
    \d       Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9] in
             bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the whole
             range of Unicode digits.
    \D       Matches any non-digit character; equivalent to [^\d].
    \s       Matches any whitespace character; equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v] in
             bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the whole
             range of Unicode whitespace characters.
    \S       Matches any non-whitespace character; equivalent to [^\s].
    \w       Matches any alphanumeric character; equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]
             in bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the
             range of Unicode alphanumeric characters (letters plus digits
             plus underscore).
             With LOCALE, it will match the set [0-9_] plus characters defined
             as letters for the current locale.
    \W       Matches the complement of \w.
    \\       Matches a literal backslash.

This module exports the following functions:
    match     Match a regular expression pattern to the beginning of a string.
    fullmatch Match a regular expression pattern to all of a string.
    search    Search a string for the presence of a pattern.
    sub       Substitute occurrences of a pattern found in a string.
    subn      Same as sub, but also return the number of substitutions made.
    split     Split a string by the occurrences of a pattern.
    findall   Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
    finditer  Return an iterator yielding a Match object for each match.
    compile   Compile a pattern into a Pattern object.
    purge     Clear the regular expression cache.
    escape    Backslash all non-alphanumerics in a string.

Each function other than purge and escape can take an optional 'flags' argument
consisting of one or more of the following module constants, joined by "|".
A, L, and U are mutually exclusive.
    A  ASCII       For string patterns, make \w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D
                   match the corresponding ASCII character categories
                   (rather than the whole Unicode categories, which is the
                   default).
                   For bytes patterns, this flag is the only available
                   behaviour and needn't be specified.
    I  IGNORECASE  Perform case-insensitive matching.
    L  LOCALE      Make \w, \W, \b, \B, dependent on the current locale.
    M  MULTILINE   "^" matches the beginning of lines (after a newline)
                   as well as the string.
                   "$" matches the end of lines (before a newline) as well
                   as the end of the string.
    S  DOTALL      "." matches any character at all, including the newline.
    X  VERBOSE     Ignore whitespace and comments for nicer looking RE's.
    U  UNICODE     For compatibility only. Ignored for string patterns (it
                   is the default), and forbidden for bytes patterns.

This module also defines an exception 'error'.

The simplest way to use this module is to call the urlopen function,
which accepts a string containing a URL or a Request object (described
below).  It opens the URL and returns the results as file-like
object; the returned object has some extra methods described below.

The OpenerDirector manages a collection of Handler objects that do
all the actual work.  Each Handler implements a particular protocol or
option.  The OpenerDirector is a composite object that invokes the
Handlers needed to open the requested URL.  For example, the
HTTPHandler performs HTTP GET and POST requests and deals with
non-error returns.  The HTTPRedirectHandler automatically deals with
HTTP 301, 302, 303 and 307 redirect errors, and the HTTPDigestAuthHandler
deals with digest authentication.

urlopen(url, data=None) -- Basic usage is the same as original
urllib.  pass the url and optionally data to post to an HTTP URL, and
get a file-like object back.  One difference is that you can also pass
a Request instance instead of URL.  Raises a URLError (subclass of
OSError); for HTTP errors, raises an HTTPError, which can also be
treated as a valid response.

build_opener -- Function that creates a new OpenerDirector instance.
Will install the default handlers.  Accepts one or more Handlers as
arguments, either instances or Handler classes that it will
instantiate.  If one of the argument is a subclass of the default
handler, the argument will be installed instead of the default.

install_opener -- Installs a new opener as the default opener.

objects of interest:

OpenerDirector -- Sets up the User Agent as the Python-urllib client and manages
the Handler classes, while dealing with requests and responses.

Request -- An object that encapsulates the state of a request.  The
state can be as simple as the URL.  It can also include extra HTTP
headers, e.g. a User-Agent.

BaseHandler --

Example usage:

import urllib.request

# set up authentication info
authinfo = urllib.request.HTTPBasicAuthHandler()

    *data* must be an object specifying additional data to be sent to
    the server, or None if no such data is needed.  See Request for
    details.

    urllib.request module uses HTTP/1.1 and includes a "Connection:close"
    header in its HTTP requests.

    The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for
    blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the
    global default timeout setting will be used). This only works for HTTP,
    HTTPS and FTP connections.

    If *context* is specified, it must be a ssl.SSLContext instance describing
    the various SSL options. See HTTPSConnection for more details.

    The optional *cafile* and *capath* parameters specify a set of trusted CA
    certificates for HTTPS requests. cafile should point to a single file
    containing a bundle of CA certificates, whereas capath should point to a
    directory of hashed certificate files. More information can be found in
    ssl.SSLContext.load_verify_locations().

    The *cadefault* parameter is ignored.


    This function always returns an object which can work as a
    context manager and has the properties url, headers, and status.
    See urllib.response.addinfourl for more detail on these properties.

    For HTTP and HTTPS URLs, this function returns a http.client.HTTPResponse
    object slightly modified. In addition to the three new methods above, the
    msg attribute contains the same information as the reason attribute ---
    the reason phrase returned by the server --- instead of the response
    headers as it is specified in the documentation for HTTPResponse.

    For FTP, file, and data URLs and requests explicitly handled by legacy
    URLopener and FancyURLopener classes, this function returns a
    urllib.response.addinfourl object.

    Note that None may be returned if no handler handles the request (though
    the default installed global OpenerDirector uses UnknownHandler to ensure
    this never happens).

    In addition, if proxy settings are detected (for example, when a *_proxy
    environment variable like http_proxy is set), ProxyHandler is default
    installed and makes sure the requests are handled through the proxy.

    Retrieve a URL into a temporary location on disk.

    Requires a URL argument. If a filename is passed, it is used as
    the temporary file location. The reporthook argument should be
    a callable that accepts a block number, a read size, and the
    total file size of the URL target. The data argument should be
    valid URL encoded data.

    If a filename is passed and the URL points to a local resource,
    the result is a copy from local file to new file.

Note: BaseHTTPRequestHandler doesn't implement any HTTP request; see
SimpleHTTPRequestHandler for simple implementations of GET, HEAD and POST,
and CGIHTTPRequestHandler for CGI scripts.

It does, however, optionally implement HTTP/1.1 persistent connections,
as of version 0.3.

Notes on CGIHTTPRequestHandler
------------------------------

This class implements GET and POST requests to cgi-bin scripts.

If the os.fork() function is not present (e.g. on Windows),
subprocess.Popen() is used as a fallback, with slightly altered semantics.

In all cases, the implementation is intentionally naive -- all
requests are executed synchronously.

SECURITY WARNING: DON'T USE THIS CODE UNLESS YOU ARE INSIDE A FIREWALL
-- it may execute arbitrary Python code or external programs.

Note that status code 200 is sent prior to execution of a CGI script, so
scripts cannot send other status codes such as 302 (redirect).

XXX To do:

- log requests even later (to capture byte count)
- log user-agent header and other interesting goodies
- send error log to separate file

    The following explanation of HTTP serves to guide you through the
    code as well as to expose any misunderstandings I may have about
    HTTP (so you don't need to read the code to figure out I'm wrong
    :-).

    HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an extensible protocol on
    top of a reliable stream transport (e.g. TCP/IP).  The protocol
    recognizes three parts to a request:

    1. One line identifying the request type and path
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. An optional data part

    The headers and data are separated by a blank line.

    The first line of the request has the form

    <command> <path> <version>

    where <command> is a (case-sensitive) keyword such as GET or POST,
    <path> is a string containing path information for the request,
    and <version> should be the string "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".
    <path> is encoded using the URL encoding scheme (using %xx to signify
    the ASCII character with hex code xx).

    The specification specifies that lines are separated by CRLF but
    for compatibility with the widest range of clients recommends
    servers also handle LF.  Similarly, whitespace in the request line
    is treated sensibly (allowing multiple spaces between components
    and allowing trailing whitespace).

    Similarly, for output, lines ought to be separated by CRLF pairs
    but most clients grok LF characters just fine.

    If the first line of the request has the form

    <command> <path>

    (i.e. <version> is left out) then this is assumed to be an HTTP
    0.9 request; this form has no optional headers and data part and
    the reply consists of just the data.

    The reply form of the HTTP 1.x protocol again has three parts:

    1. One line giving the response code
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. The data

    Again, the headers and data are separated by a blank line.

    The response code line has the form

    <version> <responsecode> <responsestring>

    where <version> is the protocol version ("HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1"),
    <responsecode> is a 3-digit response code indicating success or
    failure of the request, and <responsestring> is an optional
    human-readable string explaining what the response code means.

    This server parses the request and the headers, and then calls a
    function specific to the request type (<command>).  Specifically,
    a request SPAM will be handled by a method do_SPAM().  If no
    such method exists the server sends an error response to the
    client.  If it exists, it is called with no arguments:

    do_SPAM()

    Note that the request name is case sensitive (i.e. SPAM and spam
    are different requests).

    The various request details are stored in instance variables:

    - client_address is the client IP address in the form (host,
    port);

    - command, path and version are the broken-down request line;

    - headers is an instance of email.message.Message (or a derived
    class) containing the header information;

    - rfile is a file object open for reading positioned at the
    start of the optional input data part;

    - wfile is a file object open for writing.

    IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADHERE TO THE PROTOCOL FOR WRITING!

    The first thing to be written must be the response line.  Then
    follow 0 or more header lines, then a blank line, and then the
    actual data (if any).  The meaning of the header lines depends on
    the command executed by the server; in most cases, when data is
    returned, there should be at least one header line of the form

    Content-type: <type>/<subtype>

    where <type> and <subtype> should be registered MIME types,
    e.g. "text/html" or "text/plain".

    ''Python/''BaseHTTP/''Parse a request (internal).

        The request should be stored in self.raw_requestline; the results
        are in self.command, self.path, self.request_version and
        self.headers.

        Return True for success, False for failure; on failure, any relevant
        error response has already been sent back.

        ''Bad request version (%r)''Invalid HTTP version (%s)''Bad request syntax (%r)''Bad HTTP/0.9 request type (%r)''Line too long''Too many headers''Expect''100-continue''Decide what to do with an "Expect: 100-continue" header.

        If the client is expecting a 100 Continue response, we must
        respond with either a 100 Continue or a final response before
        waiting for the request body. The default is to always respond
        with a 100 Continue. You can behave differently (for example,
        reject unauthorized requests) by overriding this method.

        This method should either return True (possibly after sending
        a 100 Continue response) or send an error response and return
        False.

        ''Handle a single HTTP request.

        You normally don't need to override this method; see the class
        __doc__ string for information on how to handle specific HTTP
        commands such as GET and POST.

        ''Unsupported method (%r)''Request timed out: %r''Handle multiple requests if necessary.''explain''Send and log an error reply.

        Arguments are
        * code:    an HTTP error code
                   3 digits
        * message: a simple optional 1 line reason phrase.
                   *( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / %x80-FF )
                   defaults to short entry matching the response code
        * explain: a detailed message defaults to the long entry
                   matching the response code.

        This sends an error response (so it must be called before any
        output has been generated), logs the error, and finally sends
        a piece of HTML explaining the error to the user.

        ''code %d, message %s''Add the response header to the headers buffer and log the
        response code.

        Also send two standard headers with the server software
        version and the current date.

        ''Date''Send the response header only.''_headers_buffer''%s %d %s
''Send a MIME header to the headers buffer.''%s: %s
''Send the blank line ending the MIME headers.''Log an accepted request.

        This is called by send_response().

        ''"%s" %s %s''Log an error.

        This is called when a request cannot be fulfilled.  By
        default it passes the message on to log_message().

        Arguments are the same as for log_message().

        XXX This should go to the separate error log.

        ''\x''Log an arbitrary message.

        This is used by all other logging functions.  Override
        it if you have specific logging wishes.

        The first argument, FORMAT, is a format string for the
        message to be logged.  If the format string contains
        any % escapes requiring parameters, they should be
        specified as subsequent arguments (it's just like
        printf!).

        The client ip and current date/time are prefixed to
        every message.

        Unicode control characters are replaced with escaped hex
        before writing the output to stderr.

        ''%s - - [%s] %s

    This serves files from the current directory and any of its
    subdirectories.  The MIME type for files is determined by
    calling the .guess_type() method.

    The GET and HEAD requests are identical except that the HEAD
    request omits the actual contents of the file.

        This sends the response code and MIME headers.

        Return value is either a file object (which has to be copied
        to the outputfile by the caller unless the command was HEAD,
        and must be closed by the caller under all circumstances), or
        None, in which case the caller has nothing further to do.

        Return value is either a file object, or None (indicating an
        error).  In either case, the headers are sent, making the
        interface the same as for send_head().

        probably be diagnosed.)

        ''Copy all data between two file objects.

        The SOURCE argument is a file object open for reading
        (or anything with a read() method) and the DESTINATION
        argument is a file object open for writing (or
        anything with a write() method).

        The only reason for overriding this would be to change
        the block size or perhaps to replace newlines by CRLF
        -- note however that this the default server uses this
        to copy binary data as well.

        ''copyfileobj''Guess the type of a file.

        Argument is a PATH (a filename).

        Return value is a string of the form type/subtype,
        usable for a MIME Content-type header.

        The default implementation looks the file's extension
        up in the table self.extensions_map, using application/octet-stream
        as a default; however it would be permissible (if
        slow) to look inside the data to make a better guess.

        Returns True and updates the cgi_info attribute to the tuple
        (dir, rest) if self.path requires running a CGI script.
        Returns False otherwise.

        If any exception is raised, the caller should assume that
        self.path was rejected as invalid and act accordingly.

        The default implementation tests whether the normalized url
        path begins with one of the strings in self.cgi_directories
        (and the next character is a '/' or the end of the string).

    Copy the permission bits, last access time, last modification time, and

    unaffected. `src` and `dst` are path-like objects or path names given as
    strings.

    If the optional flag `follow_symlinks` is not set, symlinks aren't
    followed if and only if both `src` and `dst` are symlinks.

    The destination may be a directory.

    If follow_symlinks is false, symlinks won't be followed. This
    resembles GNU's "cp -P src dst".

    If source and destination are the same file, a SameFileError will be
    raised.

    ''Copy data and metadata. Return the file's destination.

    Metadata is copied with copystat(). Please see the copystat function

    ''Function that can be used as copytree() ignore parameter.

    Patterns is a sequence of glob-style patterns

    If exception(s) occur, an Error is raised with a list of reasons.

    If the optional symlinks flag is true, symbolic links in the
    source tree result in symbolic links in the destination tree; if
    it is false, the contents of the files pointed to by symbolic
    links are copied. If the file pointed by the symlink doesn't
    exist, an exception will be added in the list of errors raised in
    an Error exception at the end of the copy process.

    You can set the optional ignore_dangling_symlinks flag to true if you
    want to silence this exception. Notice that this has no effect on
    platforms that don't support os.symlink.

    The optional ignore argument is a callable. If given, it
    is called with the `src` parameter, which is the directory
    being visited by copytree(), and `names` which is the list of
    `src` contents, as returned by os.listdir():

        callable(src, names) -> ignored_names

    Since copytree() is called recursively, the callable will be
    called once for each directory that is copied. It returns a
    list of names relative to the `src` directory that should
    not be copied.

    The optional copy_function argument is a callable that will be used
    to copy each file. It will be called with the source path and the
    destination path as arguments. By default, copy2() is used, but any
    function that supports the same signature (like copy()) can be used.

    If dirs_exist_ok is false (the default) and `dst` already exists, a
    `FileExistsError` is raised. If `dirs_exist_ok` is true, the copying
    operation will continue if it encounters existing directories, and files
    within the `dst` tree will be overwritten by corresponding files from the
    `src` tree.
    ''shutil.copytree''st_file_attributes''Cannot call rmtree on a symbolic link''Recursively delete a directory tree.

    If ignore_errors is set, errors are ignored; otherwise, if onerror
    is set, it is called to handle the error with arguments (func,
    path, exc_info) where func is platform and implementation dependent;
    path is the argument to that function that caused it to fail; and
    exc_info is a tuple returned by sys.exc_info().  If ignore_errors
    is false and onerror is None, an exception is raised.

    ''shutil.rmtree''A basename() variant which first strips the trailing slash, if present.
    Thus we always get the last component of the path, even for directories.

    path: Union[PathLike, str]

    e.g.
    >>> os.path.basename('/bar/foo')
    'foo'
    >>> os.path.basename('/bar/foo/')
    ''
    >>> _basename('/bar/foo/')
    'foo'
    ''Recursively move a file or directory to another location. This is
    similar to the Unix "mv" command. Return the file or directory's
    destination.

    If the destination is a directory or a symlink to a directory, the source
    is moved inside the directory. The destination path must not already
    exist.

    If the destination already exists but is not a directory, it may be
    overwritten depending on os.rename() semantics.

    If the destination is on our current filesystem, then rename() is used.
    Otherwise, src is copied to the destination and then removed. Symlinks are
    recreated under the new name if os.rename() fails because of cross
    filesystem renames.

    The optional `copy_function` argument is a callable that will be used
    to copy the source or it will be delegated to `copytree`.
    By default, copy2() is used, but any function that supports the same
    signature (like copy()) can be used.

    A lot more could be done here...  A look at a mv.c shows a lot of
    the issues this implementation glosses over.

    `name` is the name of the format. `extensions` is a list of extensions
    corresponding to the format.

    `function` is the callable that will be
    used to unpack archives. The callable will receive archives to unpack.
    If it's unable to handle an archive, it needs to raise a ReadError
    exception.

    If provided, `extra_args` is a sequence of
    (name, value) tuples that will be passed as arguments to the callable.
    description can be provided to describe the format, and will be returned
    by the get_unpack_formats() function.

    by invoking os.get_terminal_size.

    If the terminal size cannot be successfully queried, either because
    the system doesn't support querying, or because we are not
    connected to a terminal, the value given in fallback parameter
    is used. Fallback defaults to (80, 24) which is the default

    ''Generic socket server classes.

This module tries to capture the various aspects of defining a server:

For socket-based servers:

- address family:
        - AF_INET{,6}: IP (Internet Protocol) sockets (default)
        - AF_UNIX: Unix domain sockets
        - others, e.g. AF_DECNET are conceivable (see <socket.h>
- socket type:
        - SOCK_STREAM (reliable stream, e.g. TCP)
        - SOCK_DGRAM (datagrams, e.g. UDP)

For request-based servers (including socket-based):

- client address verification before further looking at the request
        (This is actually a hook for any processing that needs to look
         at the request before anything else, e.g. logging)
- how to handle multiple requests:
        - synchronous (one request is handled at a time)
        - forking (each request is handled by a new process)
        - threading (each request is handled by a new thread)

The classes in this module favor the server type that is simplest to
write: a synchronous TCP/IP server.  This is bad class design, but
saves some typing.  (There's also the issue that a deep class hierarchy
slows down method lookups.)

There are five classes in an inheritance diagram, four of which represent
synchronous servers of four types:

        +------------+
        | BaseServer |
        +------------+
              |
              v
        +-----------+        +------------------+
        | TCPServer |------->| UnixStreamServer |
        +-----------+        +------------------+
              |
              v
        +-----------+        +--------------------+
        | UDPServer |------->| UnixDatagramServer |
        +-----------+        +--------------------+

Note that UnixDatagramServer derives from UDPServer, not from
UnixStreamServer -- the only difference between an IP and a Unix
stream server is the address family, which is simply repeated in both
unix server classes.

Forking and threading versions of each type of server can be created
using the ForkingMixIn and ThreadingMixIn mix-in classes.  For
instance, a threading UDP server class is created as follows:

        class ThreadingUDPServer(ThreadingMixIn, UDPServer): pass

The Mix-in class must come first, since it overrides a method defined
in UDPServer! Setting the various member variables also changes
the behavior of the underlying server mechanism.

To implement a service, you must derive a class from
BaseRequestHandler and redefine its handle() method.  You can then run
various versions of the service by combining one of the server classes
with your request handler class.

The request handler class must be different for datagram or stream
services.  This can be hidden by using the request handler
subclasses StreamRequestHandler or DatagramRequestHandler.

Of course, you still have to use your head!

For instance, it makes no sense to use a forking server if the service
contains state in memory that can be modified by requests (since the
modifications in the child process would never reach the initial state
kept in the parent process and passed to each child).  In this case,
you can use a threading server, but you will probably have to use
locks to avoid two requests that come in nearly simultaneous to apply
conflicting changes to the server state.

On the other hand, if you are building e.g. an HTTP server, where all
data is stored externally (e.g. in the file system), a synchronous
class will essentially render the service "deaf" while one request is
being handled -- which may be for a very long time if a client is slow
to read all the data it has requested.  Here a threading or forking
server is appropriate.

In some cases, it may be appropriate to process part of a request
synchronously, but to finish processing in a forked child depending on
the request data.  This can be implemented by using a synchronous
server and doing an explicit fork in the request handler class
handle() method.

Another approach to handling multiple simultaneous requests in an
environment that supports neither threads nor fork (or where these are
too expensive or inappropriate for the service) is to maintain an
explicit table of partially finished requests and to use a selector to
decide which request to work on next (or whether to handle a new
incoming request).  This is particularly important for stream services
where each client can potentially be connected for a long time (if
threads or subprocesses cannot be used).

Future work:
- Standard classes for Sun RPC (which uses either UDP or TCP)
- Standard mix-in classes to implement various authentication
  and encryption schemes

    defines a handle() method.

    The handle() method can find the request as self.request, the
    client address as self.client_address, and the server (in case it
    needs access to per-server information) as self.server.  Since a
    separate instance is created for each request, the handle() method

Provides the 'spawn()' function, a front-end to various platform-
specific functions for launching another program in a sub-process.
Also provides the 'find_executable()' to search the path for a given
executable name.
''Run another program, specified as a command list 'cmd', in a new process.

    'cmd' is just the argument list for the new process, ie.
    cmd[0] is the program to run and cmd[1:] are the rest of its arguments.
    There is no way to run a program with a name different from that of its
    executable.

    If 'search_path' is true (the default), the system's executable
    search path will be used to find the program; otherwise, cmd[0]
    must be the exact path to the executable.  If 'dry_run' is true,
    the command will not actually be run.

    Raise DistutilsExecError if running the program fails in any way; just

        The message callback provides a debugging hook to analyze TLS

        (header, handshake, alert, and more), but not for application data.
        Due to technical  limitations, the callback can't be used to filter
        traffic or to abort a connection. Any exception raised in the
        callback is delayed until the handshake, read, or write operation
        has been performed.

    ''certfile must be specified''This class implements an interface on top of a low-level SSL object as
    implemented by OpenSSL. This object captures the state of an SSL connection
    but does not provide any network IO itself. IO needs to be performed
    through separate "BIO" objects which are OpenSSL's IO abstraction layer.

    This class does not have a public constructor. Instances are returned by
    ``SSLContext.wrap_bio``. This class is typically used by framework authors
    that want to implement asynchronous IO for SSL through memory buffers.

    When compared to ``SSLSocket``, this object lacks the following features:

     * Any form of network IO, including methods such as ``recv`` and ``send``.
     * The ``do_handshake_on_connect`` and ``suppress_ragged_eofs`` machinery.

    ''Server side SSL needs a valid SSLContext''UNWRAPPED''DO_HANDSHAKE''WRAPPED''SHUTDOWN''An SSL "Pipe".

    An SSL pipe allows you to communicate with an SSL/TLS protocol instance
    through memory buffers. It can be used to implement a security layer for an
    existing connection where you don't have access to the connection's file
    descriptor, or for some reason you don't want to use it.

    An SSL pipe can be in "wrapped" and "unwrapped" mode. In unwrapped mode,
    data is passed through untransformed. In wrapped mode, application level
    data is encrypted to SSL record level data and vice versa. The SSL record
    level is the lowest level in the SSL protocol suite and is what travels
    as-is over the wire.

    An SslPipe initially is in "unwrapped" mode. To start SSL, call
    do_handshake(). To shutdown SSL again, call unwrap().
    ''
        The *context* argument specifies the ssl.SSLContext to use.

        The *server_side* argument indicates whether this is a server side or
        client side transport.

        The optional *server_hostname* argument can be used to specify the
        hostname you are connecting to. You may only specify this parameter if
        the _ssl module supports Server Name Indication (SNI).
        ''The SSL context passed to the constructor.''The internal ssl.SSLObject instance.

        Return None if the pipe is not wrapped.
        ''Whether more record level data is needed to complete a handshake
        that is currently in progress.''
        Whether a security layer is currently in effect.

        Return False during handshake.
        ''Start the SSL handshake.

        Return a list of ssldata. A ssldata element is a list of buffers

        The optional *callback* argument can be used to install a callback that
        will be called when the handshake is complete. The callback will be
        called with None if successful, else an exception instance.
        ''handshake in progress or completed''Start the SSL shutdown sequence.

        Return a list of ssldata. A ssldata element is a list of buffers

        The optional *callback* argument can be used to install a callback that
        will be called when the shutdown is complete. The callback will be
        called without arguments.
        ''no security layer present''shutdown in progress''Send a potentially "ragged" EOF.

        This method will raise an SSL_ERROR_EOF exception if the EOF is
        unexpected.
        ''Feed SSL record level data into the pipe.

        The data must be a bytes instance. It is OK to send an empty bytes
        instance. This can be used to get ssldata for a handshake initiated by
        this endpoint.

        Return a (ssldata, appdata) tuple. The ssldata element is a list of
        buffers containing SSL data that needs to be sent to the remote SSL.

        The appdata element is a list of buffers containing plaintext data that
        needs to be forwarded to the application. The appdata list may contain
        an empty buffer indicating an SSL "close_notify" alert. This alert must
        be acknowledged by calling shutdown().
        ''Feed plaintext data into the pipe.

        Return an (ssldata, offset) tuple. The ssldata element is a list of
        buffers containing record level data that needs to be sent to the
        remote SSL instance. The offset is the number of plaintext bytes that
        were processed, which may be less than the length of data.

        NOTE: In case of short writes, this call MUST be retried with the SAME
        buffer passed into the *data* argument (i.e. the id() must be the
        same). This is an OpenSSL requirement. A further particularity is that
        a short write will always have offset == 0, because the _ssl module
        does not enable partial writes. And even though the offset is zero,
        there will still be encrypted data in ssldata.
        ''PROTOCOL_IS_SHUTDOWN''Get optional transport information.''Close the transport.

        Buffered data will be flushed asynchronously.  No more data

        These two values control when to call the protocol's

        the low-water limit must be less than or equal to the
        high-water limit.  Neither value can be negative.

        The defaults are implementation-specific.  If only the
        high-water limit is given, the low-water limit defaults to an
        implementation-specific value less than or equal to the
        high-water limit.  Setting high to zero forces low to zero as
        well, and causes pause_writing() to be called whenever the
        buffer becomes non-empty.  Setting low to zero causes
        resume_writing() to be called only once the buffer is empty.
        Use of zero for either limit is generally sub-optimal as it
        reduces opportunities for doing I/O and computation

    This method takes an iterable of coroutine functions. The first one is
    started immediately. From then on, whenever the immediately preceding one
    fails (raises an exception), or when *delay* seconds has passed, the next
    coroutine is started. This continues until one of the coroutines complete
    successfully, in which case all others are cancelled, or until all
    coroutines fail.

    The coroutines provided should be well-behaved in the following way:

    * They should only ``return`` if completed successfully.

    * They should always raise an exception if they did not complete
      successfully. In particular, if they handle cancellation, they should
      probably reraise, like this::

        try:
            # do work
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            # undo partially completed work
            raise

    Args:
        coro_fns: an iterable of coroutine functions, i.e. callables that
            return a coroutine object when called. Use ``functools.partial`` or
            lambdas to pass arguments.

        delay: amount of time, in seconds, between starting coroutines. If
            ``None``, the coroutines will run sequentially.

        loop: the event loop to use.

    Returns:
        tuple *(winner_result, winner_index, exceptions)* where

        - *winner_result*: the result of the winning coroutine, or ``None``
          if no coroutines won.

        - *winner_index*: the index of the winning coroutine in
          ``coro_fns``, or ``None`` if no coroutines won. If the winning
          coroutine may return None on success, *winner_index* can be used
          to definitively determine whether any coroutine won.

        - *exceptions*: list of exceptions returned by the coroutines.
          ``len(exceptions)`` is equal to the number of coroutines actually
          started, and the order is the same as in ``coro_fns``. The winning
          coroutine's entry is ``None``.

Basic statistics module.

This module provides functions for calculating statistics of data, including
averages, variance, and standard deviation.

Calculating averages
--------------------

==================  ==================================================
Function            Description
==================  ==================================================
mean                Arithmetic mean (average) of data.
fmean               Fast, floating point arithmetic mean.
geometric_mean      Geometric mean of data.
harmonic_mean       Harmonic mean of data.
median              Median (middle value) of data.
median_low          Low median of data.
median_high         High median of data.
median_grouped      Median, or 50th percentile, of grouped data.
mode                Mode (most common value) of data.
multimode           List of modes (most common values of data).
quantiles           Divide data into intervals with equal probability.
==================  ==================================================

Calculate the arithmetic mean ("the average") of data:

>>> mean([-1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 5.75])
2.625


Calculate the standard median of discrete data:

>>> median([2, 3, 4, 5])
3.5


Calculate the median, or 50th percentile, of data grouped into class intervals
centred on the data values provided. E.g. if your data points are rounded to
the nearest whole number:

>>> median_grouped([2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
2.8333333333...

This should be interpreted in this way: you have two data points in the class
interval 1.5-2.5, three data points in the class interval 2.5-3.5, and one in
the class interval 3.5-4.5. The median of these data points is 2.8333...


Calculating variability or spread
---------------------------------

==================  =============================================
Function            Description
==================  =============================================
pvariance           Population variance of data.
variance            Sample variance of data.
pstdev              Population standard deviation of data.
stdev               Sample standard deviation of data.
==================  =============================================

Calculate the standard deviation of sample data:

>>> stdev([2.5, 3.25, 5.5, 11.25, 11.75])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
4.38961843444...

If you have previously calculated the mean, you can pass it as the optional
second argument to the four "spread" functions to avoid recalculating it:

>>> data = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]
>>> mu = mean(data)
>>> pvariance(data, mu)
2.5


Statistics for relations between two inputs
-------------------------------------------

==================  ====================================================
Function            Description
==================  ====================================================
covariance          Sample covariance for two variables.
correlation         Pearson's correlation coefficient for two variables.
linear_regression   Intercept and slope for simple linear regression.
==================  ====================================================

Calculate covariance, Pearson's correlation, and simple linear regression
for two inputs:

>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> y = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
>>> covariance(x, y)
0.75
>>> correlation(x, y)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
0.31622776601...
>>> linear_regression(x, y)  #doctest:
LinearRegression(slope=0.1, intercept=1.5)


Exceptions
----------

A single exception is defined: StatisticsError is a subclass of ValueError.

''NormalDist''StatisticsError''correlation''covariance''geometric_mean''harmonic_mean''linear_regression''median''median_grouped''median_high''median_low''multimode''pstdev''pvariance''quantiles''variance''_sum(data) -> (type, sum, count)

    Return a high-precision sum of the given numeric data as a fraction,
    together with the type to be converted to and the count of items.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> _sum([3, 2.25, 4.5, -0.5, 0.25])
    (<class 'float'>, Fraction(19, 2), 5)

    Some sources of round-off error will be avoided:

    # Built-in sum returns zero.
    >>> _sum([1e50, 1, -1e50] * 1000)
    (<class 'float'>, Fraction(1000, 1), 3000)

    Fractions and Decimals are also supported:

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> _sum([F(2, 3), F(7, 5), F(1, 4), F(5, 6)])
    (<class 'fractions.Fraction'>, Fraction(63, 20), 4)

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> data = [D("0.1375"), D("0.2108"), D("0.3061"), D("0.0419")]
    >>> _sum(data)
    (<class 'decimal.Decimal'>, Fraction(6963, 10000), 4)

    Mixed types are currently treated as an error, except that int is
    allowed.
    ''Coerce types T and S to a common type, or raise TypeError.

    Coercion rules are currently an implementation detail. See the CoerceTest
    test class in test_statistics for details.
    ''initial type T is bool''don't know how to coerce %s and %s''Return Real number x to exact (numerator, denominator) pair.

    >>> _exact_ratio(0.25)
    (1, 4)

    x is expected to be an int, Fraction, Decimal or float.
    ''can't convert type '''' to numerator/denominator''Convert value to given numeric type T.''Locate the leftmost value exactly equal to x''Locate the rightmost value exactly equal to x''negative value''Iterate over values, failing if any are less than zero.''Return the sample arithmetic mean of data.

    >>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])
    2.8

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> mean([F(3, 7), F(1, 21), F(5, 3), F(1, 3)])
    Fraction(13, 21)

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> mean([D("0.5"), D("0.75"), D("0.625"), D("0.375")])
    Decimal('0.5625')

    If ``data`` is empty, StatisticsError will be raised.
    ''mean requires at least one data point''Convert data to floats and compute the arithmetic mean.

    This runs faster than the mean() function and it always returns a float.
    If the input dataset is empty, it raises a StatisticsError.

    >>> fmean([3.5, 4.0, 5.25])
    4.25
    ''fmean requires at least one data point''Convert data to floats and compute the geometric mean.

    Raises a StatisticsError if the input dataset is empty,
    if it contains a zero, or if it contains a negative value.

    No special efforts are made to achieve exact results.
    (However, this may change in the future.)

    >>> round(geometric_mean([54, 24, 36]), 9)
    36.0
    ''geometric mean requires a non-empty dataset containing positive numbers''Return the harmonic mean of data.

    The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the
    reciprocals of the data.  It can be used for averaging ratios or
    rates, for example speeds.

    Suppose a car travels 40 km/hr for 5 km and then speeds-up to
    60 km/hr for another 5 km. What is the average speed?

        >>> harmonic_mean([40, 60])
        48.0

    Suppose a car travels 40 km/hr for 5 km, and when traffic clears,
    speeds-up to 60 km/hr for the remaining 30 km of the journey. What
    is the average speed?

        >>> harmonic_mean([40, 60], weights=[5, 30])
        56.0

    If ``data`` is empty, or any element is less than zero,
    ``harmonic_mean`` will raise ``StatisticsError``.
    ''harmonic mean does not support negative values''harmonic_mean requires at least one data point''unsupported type''Number of weights does not match data size''Weighted sum must be positive''Return the median (middle value) of numeric data.

    When the number of data points is odd, return the middle data point.
    When the number of data points is even, the median is interpolated by
    taking the average of the two middle values:

    >>> median([1, 3, 5])
    3
    >>> median([1, 3, 5, 7])
    4.0

    ''no median for empty data''Return the low median of numeric data.

    When the number of data points is odd, the middle value is returned.
    When it is even, the smaller of the two middle values is returned.

    >>> median_low([1, 3, 5])
    3
    >>> median_low([1, 3, 5, 7])
    3

    ''Return the high median of data.

    When the number of data points is odd, the middle value is returned.
    When it is even, the larger of the two middle values is returned.

    >>> median_high([1, 3, 5])
    3
    >>> median_high([1, 3, 5, 7])
    5

    ''Return the 50th percentile (median) of grouped continuous data.

    >>> median_grouped([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5])
    3.7
    >>> median_grouped([52, 52, 53, 54])
    52.5

    This calculates the median as the 50th percentile, and should be
    used when your data is continuous and grouped. In the above example,
    the values 1, 2, 3, etc. actually represent the midpoint of classes
    0.5-1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5, etc. The middle value falls somewhere in
    class 3.5-4.5, and interpolation is used to estimate it.

    Optional argument ``interval`` represents the class interval, and
    defaults to 1. Changing the class interval naturally will change the
    interpolated 50th percentile value:

    >>> median_grouped([1, 3, 3, 5, 7], interval=1)
    3.25
    >>> median_grouped([1, 3, 3, 5, 7], interval=2)
    3.5

    This function does not check whether the data points are at least
    ``interval`` apart.
    ''expected number but got %r''Return the most common data point from discrete or nominal data.

    ``mode`` assumes discrete data, and returns a single value. This is the
    standard treatment of the mode as commonly taught in schools:

        >>> mode([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4])
        3

    This also works with nominal (non-numeric) data:

        >>> mode(["red", "blue", "blue", "red", "green", "red", "red"])
        'red'

    If there are multiple modes with same frequency, return the first one
    encountered:

        >>> mode(['red', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'blue'])
        'red'

    If *data* is empty, ``mode``, raises StatisticsError.

    ''no mode for empty data''Return a list of the most frequently occurring values.

    Will return more than one result if there are multiple modes
    or an empty list if *data* is empty.

    >>> multimode('aabbbbbbbbcc')
    ['b']
    >>> multimode('aabbbbccddddeeffffgg')
    ['b', 'd', 'f']
    >>> multimode('')
    []
    ''exclusive''Divide *data* into *n* continuous intervals with equal probability.

    Returns a list of (n - 1) cut points separating the intervals.

    Set *n* to 4 for quartiles (the default).  Set *n* to 10 for deciles.
    Set *n* to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that
    separate *data* in to 100 equal sized groups.

    The *data* can be any iterable containing sample.
    The cut points are linearly interpolated between data points.

    If *method* is set to *inclusive*, *data* is treated as population
    data.  The minimum value is treated as the 0th percentile and the
    maximum value is treated as the 100th percentile.
    ''n must be at least 1''ld''must have at least two data points''inclusive''Unknown method: ''Return sum of square deviations of sequence data.

    If ``c`` is None, the mean is calculated in one pass, and the deviations
    from the mean are calculated in a second pass. Otherwise, deviations are
    calculated from ``c`` as given. Use the second case with care, as it can
    lead to garbage results.
    ''Return the sample variance of data.

    data should be an iterable of Real-valued numbers, with at least two
    values. The optional argument xbar, if given, should be the mean of
    the data. If it is missing or None, the mean is automatically calculated.

    Use this function when your data is a sample from a population. To
    calculate the variance from the entire population, see ``pvariance``.

    Examples:

    >>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5]
    >>> variance(data)
    1.3720238095238095

    If you have already calculated the mean of your data, you can pass it as
    the optional second argument ``xbar`` to avoid recalculating it:

    >>> m = mean(data)
    >>> variance(data, m)
    1.3720238095238095

    This function does not check that ``xbar`` is actually the mean of
    ``data``. Giving arbitrary values for ``xbar`` may lead to invalid or
    impossible results.

    Decimals and Fractions are supported:

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> variance([D("27.5"), D("30.25"), D("30.25"), D("34.5"), D("41.75")])
    Decimal('31.01875')

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> variance([F(1, 6), F(1, 2), F(5, 3)])
    Fraction(67, 108)

    ''variance requires at least two data points''Return the population variance of ``data``.

    data should be a sequence or iterable of Real-valued numbers, with at least one
    value. The optional argument mu, if given, should be the mean of
    the data. If it is missing or None, the mean is automatically calculated.

    Use this function to calculate the variance from the entire population.
    To estimate the variance from a sample, the ``variance`` function is
    usually a better choice.

    Examples:

    >>> data = [0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.75, 3.25]
    >>> pvariance(data)
    1.25

    If you have already calculated the mean of the data, you can pass it as
    the optional second argument to avoid recalculating it:

    >>> mu = mean(data)
    >>> pvariance(data, mu)
    1.25

    Decimals and Fractions are supported:

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> pvariance([D("27.5"), D("30.25"), D("30.25"), D("34.5"), D("41.75")])
    Decimal('24.815')

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> pvariance([F(1, 4), F(5, 4), F(1, 2)])
    Fraction(13, 72)

    ''pvariance requires at least one data point''Return the square root of the sample variance.

    See ``variance`` for arguments and other details.

    >>> stdev([1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 4.75])

    ''Covariance

    Return the sample covariance of two inputs *x* and *y*. Covariance
    is a measure of the joint variability of two inputs.

    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    >>> y = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

    ''covariance requires that both inputs have same number of data points''covariance requires at least two data points''Pearson's correlation coefficient

    Return the Pearson's correlation coefficient for two inputs. Pearson's
    correlation coefficient *r* takes values between -1 and +1. It measures the
    strength and direction of the linear relationship, where +1 means very
    strong, positive linear relationship, -1 very strong, negative linear
    relationship, and 0 no linear relationship.

    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    Return the slope and intercept of simple linear regression
    parameters estimated using ordinary least squares. Simple linear
    regression describes relationship between an independent variable
    *x* and a dependent variable *y* in terms of linear function:

        y = slope * x + intercept + noise

    where *slope* and *intercept* are the regression parameters that are
    estimated, and noise represents the variability of the data that was
    not explained by the linear regression (it is equal to the
    difference between predicted and actual values of the dependent
    variable).

    The parameters are returned as a named tuple.

        Finds the value of the random variable such that the probability of
        the variable being less than or equal to that value equals the given
        probability.

        This function is also called the percent point function or quantile
        function.
        ''p must be in the range 0.0 < p < 1.0''cdf() not defined when sigma at or below zero''Divide into *n* continuous intervals with equal probability.

        Returns a list of (n - 1) cut points separating the intervals.

        Set *n* to 4 for quartiles (the default).  Set *n* to 10 for deciles.
        Set *n* to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that
        separate the normal distribution in to 100 equal sized groups.
        ''Compute the overlapping coefficient (OVL) between two normal distributions.

        Measures the agreement between two normal probability distributions.

        If *other* is a constant, translate mu by the constant,
        leaving sigma unchanged.

        If *other* is a NormalDist, add both the means and the variances.
        Mathematically, this works only if the two distributions are

    The reader returned is a StreamReader instance; the writer is a
    StreamWriter instance.

    The arguments are all the usual arguments to create_connection()
    except protocol_factory; most common are positional host and port,
    with various optional keyword arguments following.

    Additional optional keyword arguments are loop (to set the event loop
    instance to use) and limit (to set the buffer limit passed to the
    StreamReader).

    (If you want to customize the StreamReader and/or
    StreamReaderProtocol classes, just copy the code -- there's
    really nothing special here except some convenience.)
    ''Start a socket server, call back for each client connected.

    The first parameter, `client_connected_cb`, takes two parameters:
    client_reader, client_writer.  client_reader is a StreamReader
    object, while client_writer is a StreamWriter object.  This
    parameter can either be a plain callback function or a coroutine;
    if it is a coroutine, it will be automatically converted into a
    Task.

    The rest of the arguments are all the usual arguments to
    loop.create_server() except protocol_factory; most common are
    positional host and port, with various optional keyword arguments
    following.  The return value is the same as loop.create_server().

    Additional optional keyword arguments are loop (to set the event loop
    instance to use) and limit (to set the buffer limit passed to the
    StreamReader).

    The return value is the same as loop.create_server(), i.e. a
    Server object which can be used to stop the service.
    ''Similar to `open_connection` but works with UNIX Domain Sockets.''Similar to `start_server` but works with UNIX Domain Sockets.''Reusable flow control logic for StreamWriter.drain().

    This implements the protocol methods pause_writing(),
    resume_writing() and connection_lost().  If the subclass overrides
    these it must call the super methods.

    StreamWriter.drain() must wait for _drain_helper() coroutine.
    ''%r pauses writing''%r resumes writing''Connection lost''Helper class to adapt between Protocol and StreamReader.

    (This is a helper class instead of making StreamReader itself a
    Protocol subclass, because the StreamReader has other potential
    uses, and to prevent the user of the StreamReader to accidentally
    call inappropriate methods of the protocol.)
    ''An open stream was garbage collected prior to establishing network connection; call "stream.close()" explicitly.''Wraps a Transport.

    This exposes write(), writelines(), [can_]write_eof(),
    get_extra_info() and close().  It adds drain() which returns an
    optional Future on which you can wait for flow control.  It also
    adds a transport property which references the Transport
    directly.
    ''transport=''reader=''Flush the write buffer.

        The intended use is to write

          w.write(data)
          await w.drain()
        ''Limit cannot be <= 0'' bytes''limit=''waiter=''paused''Wakeup read*() functions waiting for data or EOF.''Transport already set''Return True if the buffer is empty and 'feed_eof' was called.''feed_data after feed_eof''Wait until feed_data() or feed_eof() is called.

        If stream was paused, automatically resume it.
        ''() called while another coroutine is already waiting for incoming data''_wait_for_data after EOF''Read chunk of data from the stream until newline (b'
') is found.

        On success, return chunk that ends with newline. If only partial
        line can be read due to EOF, return incomplete line without
        terminating newline. When EOF was reached while no bytes read, empty
        bytes object is returned.

        If limit is reached, ValueError will be raised. In that case, if
        newline was found, complete line including newline will be removed
        from internal buffer. Else, internal buffer will be cleared. Limit is
        compared against part of the line without newline.

        If stream was paused, this function will automatically resume it if
        needed.
        ''readuntil''Read data from the stream until ``separator`` is found.

        On success, the data and separator will be removed from the
        internal buffer (consumed). Returned data will include the
        separator at the end.

        Configured stream limit is used to check result. Limit sets the
        maximal length of data that can be returned, not counting the
        separator.

        If an EOF occurs and the complete separator is still not found,
        an IncompleteReadError exception will be raised, and the internal
        buffer will be reset.  The IncompleteReadError.partial attribute
        may contain the separator partially.

        If the data cannot be read because of over limit, a
        LimitOverrunError exception  will be raised, and the data
        will be left in the internal buffer, so it can be read again.
        ''Separator should be at least one-byte string''Separator is not found, and chunk exceed the limit''Separator is found, but chunk is longer than limit''Read up to `n` bytes from the stream.

        If `n` is not provided or set to -1,
        read until EOF, then return all read bytes.
        If EOF was received and the internal buffer is empty,
        return an empty bytes object.

        If `n` is 0, return an empty bytes object immediately.

        If `n` is positive, return at most `n` available bytes
        as soon as at least 1 byte is available in the internal buffer.
        If EOF is received before any byte is read, return an empty
        bytes object.

        Returned value is not limited with limit, configured at stream
        creation.

        If stream was paused, this function will automatically resume it if
        needed.
        ''readexactly''Read exactly `n` bytes.

        Raise an IncompleteReadError if EOF is reached before `n` bytes can be
        read. The IncompleteReadError.partial attribute of the exception will
        contain the partial read bytes.

        if n is zero, return empty bytes object.

        Returned value is not limited with limit, configured at stream
        creation.

        If stream was paused, this function will automatically resume it if
        needed.
        ''readexactly size can not be less than zero''A collection of string constants.

Main API
========
run(...): Runs a command, waits for it to complete, then returns a
          CompletedProcess instance.
Popen(...): A class for flexibly executing a command in a new process

Constants
---------
DEVNULL: Special value that indicates that os.devnull should be used
PIPE:    Special value that indicates a pipe should be created
STDOUT:  Special value that indicates that stderr should go to stdout


Older API
=========
call(...): Runs a command, waits for it to complete, then returns
    the return code.
check_call(...): Same as call() but raises CalledProcessError()
    if return code is not 0
check_output(...): Same as check_call() but returns the contents of
    stdout instead of a return code
getoutput(...): Runs a command in the shell, waits for it to complete,
    then returns the output
getstatusoutput(...): Runs a command in the shell, waits for it to complete,
    then returns a (exitcode, output) tuple

    returns a non-zero exit status.

    Attributes:
      cmd, returncode, stdout, stderr, output
    ''Command '%s' died with %r.''Command '%s' died with unknown signal %d.''Command '%s' returned non-zero exit status %d.''Alias for output attribute, to match stderr''This exception is raised when the timeout expires while waiting for a
    child process.

    Attributes:
        cmd, output, stdout, stderr, timeout
    ''Command '%s' timed out after %s seconds''handle_list''already closed''%s(%d)''Return a list of command-line arguments reproducing the current
    settings in sys.flags, sys.warnoptions and sys._xoptions.''-I''-E''error::BytesWarning''default::BytesWarning''-W''importtime''showrefcount''Run command with arguments.  Wait for command to complete or
    timeout, then return the returncode attribute.

    The arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.  Example:

    retcode = call(["ls", "-l"])
    ''Run command with arguments.  Wait for command to complete.  If
    the exit code was zero then return, otherwise raise
    CalledProcessError.  The CalledProcessError object will have the
    return code in the returncode attribute.

    The arguments are the same as for the call function.  Example:

    check_call(["ls", "-l"])
    ''Run command with arguments and return its output.

    If the exit code was non-zero it raises a CalledProcessError.  The
    CalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode
    attribute and output in the output attribute.

    The arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.  Example:

    >>> check_output(["ls", "-l", "/dev/null"])
    b'crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Oct 18  2007 /dev/null\n'

    The stdout argument is not allowed as it is used internally.
    To capture standard error in the result, use stderr=STDOUT.

    >>> check_output(["/bin/sh", "-c",
    ...               "ls -l non_existent_file ; exit 0"],
    ...              stderr=STDOUT)
    b'ls: non_existent_file: No such file or directory\n'

    There is an additional optional argument, "input", allowing you to
    pass a string to the subprocess's stdin.  If you use this argument
    you may not also use the Popen constructor's "stdin" argument, as
    it too will be used internally.  Example:

    >>> check_output(["sed", "-e", "s/foo/bar/"],
    ...              input=b"when in the course of fooman events\n")
    b'when in the course of barman events\n'

    By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any "input"
    should be bytes, and the return value will be bytes.  If in text mode,
    any "input" should be a string, and the return value will be a string
    decoded according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode
    is triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or universal_newlines.
    ''stdout argument not allowed, it will be overridden.''A process that has finished running.

    This is returned by run().

    Attributes:
      args: The list or str args passed to run().
      returncode: The exit code of the process, negative for signals.
      stdout: The standard output (None if not captured).
      stderr: The standard error (None if not captured).
    ''args={!r}''returncode={!r}''stdout={!r}''stderr={!r}''Raise CalledProcessError if the exit code is non-zero.''Run command with arguments and return a CompletedProcess instance.

    The returned instance will have attributes args, returncode, stdout and
    stderr. By default, stdout and stderr are not captured, and those attributes
    will be None. Pass stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE in order to capture them,
    or pass capture_output=True to capture both.

    If check is True and the exit code was non-zero, it raises a
    CalledProcessError. The CalledProcessError object will have the return code
    in the returncode attribute, and output & stderr attributes if those streams
    were captured.

    If timeout is given, and the process takes too long, a TimeoutExpired
    exception will be raised.

    There is an optional argument "input", allowing you to
    pass bytes or a string to the subprocess's stdin.  If you use this argument
    you may not also use the Popen constructor's "stdin" argument, as
    it will be used internally.

    By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any "input" should
    be bytes, and the stdout and stderr will be bytes. If in text mode, any
    "input" should be a string, and stdout and stderr will be strings decoded
    according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode is
    triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or universal_newlines.

    The other arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.
    ''stdin and input arguments may not both be used.''stdout and stderr arguments may not be used with capture_output.''
    Translate a sequence of arguments into a command line
    string, using the same rules as the MS C runtime:

    1) Arguments are delimited by white space, which is either a
       space or a tab.

    2) A string surrounded by double quotation marks is
       interpreted as a single argument, regardless of white space
       contained within.  A quoted string can be embedded in an
       argument.

    3) A double quotation mark preceded by a backslash is
       interpreted as a literal double quotation mark.

    4) Backslashes are interpreted literally, unless they
       immediately precede a double quotation mark.

    5) If backslashes immediately precede a double quotation mark,
       every pair of backslashes is interpreted as a literal
       backslash.  If the number of backslashes is odd, the last
       backslash escapes the next double quotation mark as
       described in rule 3.
    ''Return (exitcode, output) of executing cmd in a shell.

    Execute the string 'cmd' in a shell with 'check_output' and
    return a 2-tuple (status, output). The locale encoding is used
    to decode the output and process newlines.

    A trailing newline is stripped from the output.
    The exit status for the command can be interpreted
    according to the rules for the function 'wait'. Example:

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('ls /bin/ls')
    (0, '/bin/ls')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('cat /bin/junk')
    (1, 'cat: /bin/junk: No such file or directory')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/junk')
    (127, 'sh: /bin/junk: not found')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/kill $$')
    (-15, '')
    ''Return output (stdout or stderr) of executing cmd in a shell.

    Like getstatusoutput(), except the exit status is ignored and the return
    value is a string containing the command's output.  Example:

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> subprocess.getoutput('ls /bin/ls')
    '/bin/ls'
    ''Check if posix_spawn() can be used for subprocess.

    subprocess requires a posix_spawn() implementation that properly reports
    errors to the parent process, & sets errno on the following failures:

    * Process attribute actions failed.
    * File actions failed.
    * exec() failed.

    Prefer an implementation which can use vfork() in some cases for best
    performance.
    ''sunos5'' Execute a child program in a new process.

    For a complete description of the arguments see the Python documentation.

    Arguments:
      args: A string, or a sequence of program arguments.

      bufsize: supplied as the buffering argument to the open() function when
          creating the stdin/stdout/stderr pipe file objects

      executable: A replacement program to execute.

      stdin, stdout and stderr: These specify the executed programs' standard
          input, standard output and standard error file handles, respectively.

      preexec_fn: (POSIX only) An object to be called in the child process
          just before the child is executed.

      close_fds: Controls closing or inheriting of file descriptors.

      shell: If true, the command will be executed through the shell.

      cwd: Sets the current directory before the child is executed.

      env: Defines the environment variables for the new process.

      text: If true, decode stdin, stdout and stderr using the given encoding
          (if set) or the system default otherwise.

      universal_newlines: Alias of text, provided for backwards compatibility.

      startupinfo and creationflags (Windows only)

      restore_signals (POSIX only)

      start_new_session (POSIX only)

      group (POSIX only)

      extra_groups (POSIX only)

      pass_fds (POSIX only)

      encoding and errors: Text mode encoding and error handling to use for
          file objects stdin, stdout and stderr.

    Attributes:

        Read data from stdout and stderr, until end-of-file is
        reached.  Wait for process to terminate.

        The optional "input" argument should be data to be sent to the
        child process, or None, if no data should be sent to the child.
        communicate() returns a tuple (stdout, stderr).

        By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any
        "input" should be bytes, and the (stdout, stderr) will be bytes.
        If in text mode (indicated by self.text_mode), any "input" should
        be a string, and (stdout, stderr) will be strings decoded
        according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode
        is triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or
        universal_newlines.

        The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

        The optional limit gives the maximum number of frames to

        meaning differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is
        returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the
        oldest frames of a traceback are returned.  (This matches the
        behavior of the traceback module.)

        returned for a suspended coroutine.

        ''Request that this task cancel itself.

        This arranges for a CancelledError to be thrown into the

        The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny
        the request using try/except/finally.

        Unlike Future.cancel, this does not guarantee that the
        task will be cancelled: the exception might be caught and
        acted upon, delaying cancellation of the task or preventing
        cancellation completely.  The task may also return a value or
        raise a different exception.

        Immediately after this method is called, Task.cancelled() will
        not return True (unless the task was already cancelled).  A
        task will be marked as cancelled when the wrapped coroutine

    Returns result of the Future or coroutine.  When a timeout occurs,
    it cancels the task and raises TimeoutError.  To avoid the task
    cancellation, wrap it in shield().

    If the wait is cancelled, the task is also cancelled.

    ''Internal helper for wait().

    ''Set of Futures is empty.''Cancel the *fut* future or task and wait until it completes.''Return an iterator whose values are coroutines.

    When waiting for the yielded coroutines you'll get the results (or
    exceptions!) of the original Futures (or coroutines), in the order
    in which and as soon as they complete.

    This differs from PEP 3148; the proper way to use this is:

        for f in as_completed(fs):
            result = await f  # The 'await' may raise.
            # Use result.

    If a timeout is specified, the 'await' will raise
    TimeoutError when the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

    Note: The futures 'f' are not necessarily members of fs.
    ''expect an iterable of futures, not ''Skip one event loop run cycle.

    This is a private helper for 'asyncio.sleep()', used

    instead of creating a Future object.

    ''Helper for gather().

    This overrides cancel() to cancel all the children and act more
    like Task.cancel(), which doesn't immediately mark itself as
    cancelled.
    ''Return a future aggregating results from the given coroutines/futures.

    Coroutines will be wrapped in a future and scheduled in the event
    loop. They will not necessarily be scheduled in the same order as
    passed in.

    All futures must share the same event loop.  If all the tasks are
    done successfully, the returned future's result is the list of
    results (in the order of the original sequence, not necessarily
    the order of results arrival).  If *return_exceptions* is True,
    exceptions in the tasks are treated the same as successful
    results, and gathered in the result list; otherwise, the first
    raised exception will be immediately propagated to the returned
    future.

    Cancellation: if the outer Future is cancelled, all children (that
    have not completed yet) are also cancelled.  If any child is
    cancelled, this is treated as if it raised CancelledError --
    the outer Future is *not* cancelled in this case.  (This is to
    prevent the cancellation of one child to cause other children to
    be cancelled.)

    If *return_exceptions* is False, cancelling gather() after it
    has been marked done won't cancel any submitted awaitables.
    For instance, gather can be marked done after propagating an
    exception to the caller, therefore, calling ``gather.cancel()``
    after catching an exception (raised by one of the awaitables) from
    gather won't cancel any other awaitables.
    ''Wait for a future, shielding it from cancellation.

    The statement

        task = asyncio.create_task(something())
        res = await shield(task)

    is exactly equivalent to the statement

        res = await something()

    *except* that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the
    task running in something() is not cancelled.  From the POV of
    something(), the cancellation did not happen.  But its caller is
    still cancelled, so the yield-from expression still raises
    CancelledError.  Note: If something() is cancelled by other means
    this will still cancel shield().

    If you want to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended)
    you can combine shield() with a try/except clause, as follows:

        task = asyncio.create_task(something())
        try:
            res = await shield(task)
        except CancelledError:
            res = None

    Save a reference to tasks passed to this function, to avoid
    a task disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps
    weak references to tasks. A task that isn't referenced elsewhere
    may get garbage collected at any time, even before it's done.

This module provides generic, low- and high-level interfaces for
creating temporary files and directories.  All of the interfaces
provided by this module can be used without fear of race conditions
except for 'mktemp'.  'mktemp' is subject to race conditions and
should not be used; it is provided for backward compatibility only.

The default path names are returned as str.  If you supply bytes as
input, all return values will be in bytes.  Ex:

    >>> tempfile.mkstemp()
    (4, '/tmp/tmptpu9nin8')
    >>> tempfile.mkdtemp(suffix=b'')
    b'/tmp/tmppbi8f0hy'

This module also provides some data items to the user:

  TMP_MAX  - maximum number of names that will be tried before
             giving up.
  tempdir  - If this is set to a string before the first use of
             any routine from this module, it will be considered as
             another candidate location to store temporary files.

provides the TextFile class, which gives an interface to text files
that (optionally) takes care of stripping comments, ignoring blank
lines, and joining lines with backslashes.''Provides a file-like object that takes care of all the things you
       commonly want to do when processing a text file that has some
       line-by-line syntax: strip comments (as long as "#" is your
       comment character), skip blank lines, join adjacent lines by
       escaping the newline (ie. backslash at end of line), strip
       leading and/or trailing whitespace.  All of these are optional
       and independently controllable.

       Provides a 'warn()' method so you can generate warning messages that
       report physical line number, even if the logical line in question
       spans multiple physical lines.  Also provides 'unreadline()' for
       implementing line-at-a-time lookahead.

       Constructor is called as:

           TextFile (filename=None, file=None, **options)

       It bombs (RuntimeError) if both 'filename' and 'file' are None;
       'filename' should be a string, and 'file' a file object (or
       something that provides 'readline()' and 'close()' methods).  It is
       recommended that you supply at least 'filename', so that TextFile
       can include it in warning messages.  If 'file' is not supplied,
       TextFile creates its own using 'io.open()'.

       The options are all boolean, and affect the value returned by
       'readline()':
         strip_comments [default: true]
           strip from "#" to end-of-line, as well as any whitespace
           leading up to the "#" -- unless it is escaped by a backslash
         lstrip_ws [default: false]
           strip leading whitespace from each line before returning it
         rstrip_ws [default: true]
           strip trailing whitespace (including line terminator!) from
           each line before returning it
         skip_blanks [default: true}
           skip lines that are empty *after* stripping comments and
           whitespace.  (If both lstrip_ws and rstrip_ws are false,
           then some lines may consist of solely whitespace: these will
           *not* be skipped, even if 'skip_blanks' is true.)
         join_lines [default: false]
           if a backslash is the last non-newline character on a line
           after stripping comments and whitespace, join the following line
           to it to form one "logical line"; if N consecutive lines end
           with a backslash, then N+1 physical lines will be joined to
           form one logical line.
         collapse_join [default: false]
           strip leading whitespace from lines that are joined to their
           predecessor; only matters if (join_lines and not lstrip_ws)
         errors [default: 'strict']
           error handler used to decode the file content

       Note that since 'rstrip_ws' can strip the trailing newline, the
       semantics of 'readline()' must differ from those of the builtin file
       object's 'readline()' method!  In particular, 'readline()' returns
       None for end-of-file: an empty string might just be a blank line (or
       an all-whitespace line), if 'rstrip_ws' is true but 'skip_blanks' is

''TextWrapper''	
 ''
    Object for wrapping/filling text.  The public interface consists of
    the wrap() and fill() methods; the other methods are just there for
    subclasses to override in order to tweak the default behaviour.
    If you want to completely replace the main wrapping algorithm,
    you'll probably have to override _wrap_chunks().

    Several instance attributes control various aspects of wrapping:
      width (default: 70)
        the maximum width of wrapped lines (unless break_long_words
        is false)
      initial_indent (default: "")
        string that will be prepended to the first line of wrapped
        output.  Counts towards the line's width.
      subsequent_indent (default: "")
        string that will be prepended to all lines save the first
        of wrapped output; also counts towards each line's width.
      expand_tabs (default: true)
        Expand tabs in input text to spaces before further processing.

        Replace all whitespace characters in the input text by spaces

        details.  As an example, the text
          Look, goof-ball -- use the -b option!
        breaks into the following chunks:
          'Look,', ' ', 'goof-', 'ball', ' ', '--', ' ',

        some lines may be longer than this.)  Chunks correspond roughly
        to words and the whitespace between them: each chunk is
        indivisible (modulo 'break_long_words'), but a line break can
        come between any two chunks.  Chunks should not have internal
        whitespace; ie. a chunk is either all whitespace or a "word".
        Whitespace chunks will be removed from the beginning and end of
        lines, but apart from that whitespace is preserved.

    The func will be passed to sys.settrace() for each thread, before its run()

    ''Get the trace function as set by threading.settrace().''Factory function that returns a new reentrant lock.

    A reentrant lock must be released by the thread that acquired it. Once a
    thread has acquired a reentrant lock, the same thread may acquire it again
    without blocking; the thread must release it once for each time it has
    acquired it.

    ''This class implements reentrant lock objects.

    A reentrant lock must be released by the thread that acquired it. Once a
    thread has acquired a reentrant lock, the same thread may acquire it
    again without blocking; the thread must release it once for each time it
    has acquired it.

    ''<%s %s.%s object owner=%r count=%d at %s>''Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

        When invoked without arguments: if this thread already owns the lock,
        increment the recursion level by one, and return immediately. Otherwise,
        if another thread owns the lock, block until the lock is unlocked. Once
        the lock is unlocked (not owned by any thread), then grab ownership, set
        the recursion level to one, and return. If more than one thread is
        blocked waiting until the lock is unlocked, only one at a time will be
        able to grab ownership of the lock. There is no return value in this
        case.

        When invoked with the blocking argument set to true, do the same thing
        as when called without arguments, and return true.

        When invoked with the blocking argument set to false, do not block. If a
        call without an argument would block, return false immediately;
        otherwise, do the same thing as when called without arguments, and
        return true.

        When invoked with the floating-point timeout argument set to a positive
        value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by timeout
        and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.  Return true if the lock has
        been acquired, false if the timeout has elapsed.

        ''Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level.

        If after the decrement it is zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not owned
        by any thread), and if any other threads are blocked waiting for the
        lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed. If after
        the decrement the recursion level is still nonzero, the lock remains
        locked and owned by the calling thread.

        Only call this method when the calling thread owns the lock. A
        RuntimeError is raised if this method is called when the lock is
        unlocked.

        There is no return value.

        ''Class that implements a condition variable.

    A condition variable allows one or more threads to wait until they are
    notified by another thread.

    If the lock argument is given and not None, it must be a Lock or RLock
    object, and it is used as the underlying lock. Otherwise, a new RLock object
    is created and used as the underlying lock.

    ''<Condition(%s, %d)>''Wait until notified or until a timeout occurs.

        If the calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is
        called, a RuntimeError is raised.

        This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until it is
        awakened by a notify() or notify_all() call for the same condition
        variable in another thread, or until the optional timeout occurs. Once
        awakened or timed out, it re-acquires the lock and returns.

        When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof).

        When the underlying lock is an RLock, it is not released using its
        release() method, since this may not actually unlock the lock when it
        was acquired multiple times recursively. Instead, an internal interface
        of the RLock class is used, which really unlocks it even when it has
        been recursively acquired several times. Another internal interface is
        then used to restore the recursion level when the lock is reacquired.

        ''Wait until a condition evaluates to True.

        predicate should be a callable which result will be interpreted as a
        boolean value.  A timeout may be provided giving the maximum time to
        wait.

        ''Wake up one or more threads waiting on this condition, if any.

        This method is deprecated, use notify_all() instead.

        ''notifyAll() is deprecated, use notify_all() instead''This class implements semaphore objects.

    Semaphores manage a counter representing the number of release() calls minus
    the number of acquire() calls, plus an initial value. The acquire() method
    blocks if necessary until it can return without making the counter
    negative. If not given, value defaults to 1.

    ''semaphore initial value must be >= 0''Acquire a semaphore, decrementing the internal counter by one.

        When invoked without arguments: if the internal counter is larger than
        zero on entry, decrement it by one and return immediately. If it is zero
        on entry, block, waiting until some other thread has called release() to
        make it larger than zero. This is done with proper interlocking so that
        if multiple acquire() calls are blocked, release() will wake exactly one
        of them up. The implementation may pick one at random, so the order in
        which blocked threads are awakened should not be relied on. There is no
        return value in this case.

        When invoked with blocking set to true, do the same thing as when called
        without arguments, and return true.

        When invoked with blocking set to false, do not block. If a call without
        an argument would block, return false immediately; otherwise, do the
        same thing as when called without arguments, and return true.

        When invoked with a timeout other than None, it will block for at
        most timeout seconds.  If acquire does not complete successfully in
        that interval, return false.  Return true otherwise.

        ''can't specify timeout for non-blocking acquire''Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one or more.

        When the counter is zero on entry and another thread is waiting for it
        to become larger than zero again, wake up that thread.

        ''n must be one or more''Implements a bounded semaphore.

    A bounded semaphore checks to make sure its current value doesn't exceed its
    initial value. If it does, ValueError is raised. In most situations
    semaphores are used to guard resources with limited capacity.

    If the semaphore is released too many times it's a sign of a bug. If not
    given, value defaults to 1.

    Like regular semaphores, bounded semaphores manage a counter representing
    the number of release() calls minus the number of acquire() calls, plus an
    initial value. The acquire() method blocks if necessary until it can return
    without making the counter negative. If not given, value defaults to 1.

    ''Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one or more.

        When the counter is zero on entry and another thread is waiting for it
        to become larger than zero again, wake up that thread.

        If the number of releases exceeds the number of acquires,
        raise a ValueError.

        ''Semaphore released too many times''Class implementing event objects.

    Events manage a flag that can be set to true with the set() method and reset
    to false with the clear() method. The wait() method blocks until the flag is
    true.  The flag is initially false.

    ''Return true if and only if the internal flag is true.''Return true if and only if the internal flag is true.

        This method is deprecated, use is_set() instead.

        ''isSet() is deprecated, use is_set() instead''Set the internal flag to true.

        All threads waiting for it to become true are awakened. Threads
        that call wait() once the flag is true will not block at all.

        ''Reset the internal flag to false.

        Subsequently, threads calling wait() will block until set() is called to
        set the internal flag to true again.

        ''Block until the internal flag is true.

        If the internal flag is true on entry, return immediately. Otherwise,
        block until another thread calls set() to set the flag to true, or until
        the optional timeout occurs.

        When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof).

        This method returns the internal flag on exit, so it will always return
        True except if a timeout is given and the operation times out.

        ''signaled''Implements a Barrier.

    Useful for synchronizing a fixed number of threads at known synchronization
    points.  Threads block on 'wait()' and are simultaneously awoken once they
    have all made that call.

    ''Create a barrier, initialised to 'parties' threads.

        'action' is a callable which, when supplied, will be called by one of
        the threads after they have all entered the barrier and just prior to

        default for all subsequent 'wait()' calls.

        ''Wait for the barrier.

        When the specified number of threads have started waiting, they are all
        simultaneously awoken. If an 'action' was provided for the barrier, one

    ''A class that represents a thread of control.

    This class can be safely subclassed in a limited fashion. There are two ways
    to specify the activity: by passing a callable object to the constructor, or
    by overriding the run() method in a subclass.

    ''This constructor should always be called with keyword arguments. Arguments are:

        *group* should be None; reserved for future extension when a ThreadGroup
        class is implemented.

        *target* is the callable object to be invoked by the run()
        method. Defaults to None, meaning nothing is called.

        *name* is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed of
        the form "Thread-N" where N is a small decimal number.

        *args* is the argument tuple for the target invocation. Defaults to ().

        *kwargs* is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target
        invocation. Defaults to {}.

        If a subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure to invoke
        the base class constructor (Thread.__init__()) before doing anything
        else to the thread.

        ''Thread-%d''Thread.__init__() was not called'' daemon'' %s''Start the thread's activity.

        It must be called at most once per thread object. It arranges for the

        same thread object.

        ''thread.__init__() not called''threads can only be started once''Method representing the thread's activity.

        You may override this method in a subclass. The standard run() method
        invokes the callable object passed to the object's constructor as the
        target argument, if any, with sequential and keyword arguments taken
        from the args and kwargs arguments, respectively.

        the underlying thread state (see pystate.h) gets deleted.
        ''Remove current thread from the dict of currently running threads.''Wait until the thread terminates.

        This blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is
        called terminates -- either normally or through an unhandled exception
        or until the optional timeout occurs.

        When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call
        is_alive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the
        thread is still alive, the join() call timed out.

        When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will
        block until the thread terminates.

        A thread can be join()ed many times.

        join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to join the current
        thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also an error to join() a
        thread before it has been started and attempts to do so raises the same
        exception.

tokenize(readline) is a generator that breaks a stream of bytes into
Python tokens.  It decodes the bytes according to PEP-0263 for
determining source file encoding.

It accepts a readline-like method which is called repeatedly to get the
next line of input (or b"" for EOF).  It generates 5-tuples with these
members:

    the token type (see token.py)
    the token (a string)
    the starting (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the ending (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the original line (string)

It is designed to match the working of the Python tokenizer exactly, except
that it produces COMMENT tokens for comments and gives type OP for all
operators.  Additionally, all token lists start with an ENCODING token
which tells you which encoding was used to decode the bytes stream.

    It returns a bytes object, encoded using the ENCODING
    token, which is the first token sequence output by tokenize.

    Each element returned by the iterable must be a token sequence
    with at least two elements, a token number and token value.  If
    only two tokens are passed, the resulting output is poor.

    The detect_encoding() function is used to detect the encoding that should
    be used to decode a Python source file.  It requires one argument, readline,
    in the same way as the tokenize() generator.

    It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
    (as a string) and a list of any lines (left as bytes) it has read in.

    It detects the encoding from the presence of a utf-8 bom or an encoding
    cookie as specified in pep-0263.  If both a bom and a cookie are present,
    but disagree, a SyntaxError will be raised.  If the encoding cookie is an
    invalid charset, raise a SyntaxError.  Note that if a utf-8 bom is found,
    'utf-8-sig' is returned.

    The tokenize() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the

    should return one line of input as bytes.  Alternatively, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile, 'rb').__next__  # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found.  The line passed is the

The typing module: Support for gradual typing as defined by PEP 484.

At large scale, the structure of the module is following:
* Imports and exports, all public names should be explicitly added to __all__.
* Internal helper functions: these should never be used in code outside this module.
* _SpecialForm and its instances (special forms):
  Any, NoReturn, ClassVar, Union, Optional, Concatenate
* Classes whose instances can be type arguments in addition to types:
  ForwardRef, TypeVar and ParamSpec
* The core of internal generics API: _GenericAlias and _VariadicGenericAlias, the latter is
  currently only used by Tuple and Callable. All subscripted types like X[int], Union[int, str],
  etc., are instances of either of these classes.
* The public counterpart of the generics API consists of two classes: Generic and Protocol.
* Public helper functions: get_type_hints, overload, cast, no_type_check,
  no_type_check_decorator.
* Generic aliases for collections.abc ABCs and few additional protocols.
* Special types: NewType, NamedTuple, TypedDict.
* Wrapper submodules for re and io related types.

    special forms like Union are not valid, while Union[int, str] is OK, etc.
    The msg argument is a human-readable error message, e.g::

    If obj is a type, we return a shorter version than the default

    else, we fall back on repr(obj).

    ''Special type construct to mark class variables.

    An annotation wrapped in ClassVar indicates that a given
    attribute is intended to be used as a class variable and

          damage: int = 10                     # instance variable

    ClassVar accepts only types and cannot be further subscribed.

    Note that ClassVar is not a class itself, and should not
    be used with isinstance() or issubclass().
    '' accepts only single type.''Special typing construct to indicate final names to type checkers.

    A final name cannot be re-assigned or overridden in a subclass.
    For example:

      MAX_SIZE: Final = 9000
      MAX_SIZE += 1  # Error reported by type checker

      class Connection:
          TIMEOUT: Final[int] = 10

      class FastConnector(Connection):
          TIMEOUT = 1  # Error reported by type checker

    There is no runtime checking of these properties.
    ''Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.

    To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str].  Details:
    - The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
    - None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
      type(None).
    - Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::

        Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]

    - Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::

        Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int

    - Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::

        Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]

    - When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::

        Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]

    - You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
    - You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
    ''Cannot take a Union of no types.''Union[arg, ...]: each arg must be a type.''Optional type.

    Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].
    '' requires a single type.''Special typing form to define literal types (a.k.a. value types).

    This form can be used to indicate to type checkers that the corresponding
    variable or function parameter has a value equivalent to the provided
    literal (or one of several literals):

      def validate_simple(data: Any) -> Literal[True]:  # always returns True
          ...

      MODE = Literal['r', 'rb', 'w', 'wb']
      def open_helper(file: str, mode: MODE) -> str:
          ...

      open_helper('/some/path', 'r')  # Passes type check
      open_helper('/other/path', 'typo')  # Error in type checker

    Literal[...] cannot be subclassed. At runtime, an arbitrary value
    is allowed as type argument to Literal[...], but type checkers may
    impose restrictions.
    ''Special marker indicating that an assignment should
    be recognized as a proper type alias definition by type
    checkers.

    For example::

        Predicate: TypeAlias = Callable[..., bool]

    It's invalid when used anywhere except as in the example above.
    ''Used in conjunction with ``ParamSpec`` and ``Callable`` to represent a
    higher order function which adds, removes or transforms parameters of a

    ''Cannot take a Concatenate of no types.''The last parameter to Concatenate should be a ParamSpec variable.''Concatenate[arg, ...]: each arg must be a type.''_typevar_types''_paramspec_tvars''Special typing form used to annotate the return type of a user-defined
    type guard function.  ``TypeGuard`` only accepts a single type argument.
    At runtime, functions marked this way should return a boolean.

    ``TypeGuard`` aims to benefit *type narrowing* -- a technique used by static
    type checkers to determine a more precise type of an expression within a
    program's code flow.  Usually type narrowing is done by analyzing
    conditional code flow and applying the narrowing to a block of code.  The
    conditional expression here is sometimes referred to as a "type guard".

    Sometimes it would be convenient to use a user-defined boolean function
    as a type guard.  Such a function should use ``TypeGuard[...]`` as its
    return type to alert static type checkers to this intention.

    Using  ``-> TypeGuard`` tells the static type checker that for a given
    function:

    1. The return value is a boolean.
    2. If the return value is ``True``, the type of its argument
       is the type inside ``TypeGuard``.

       For example::

          def is_str(val: Union[str, float]):
              # "isinstance" type guard
              if isinstance(val, str):
                  # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``str``
                  ...
              else:
                  # Else, type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``float``.
                  ...

    Strict type narrowing is not enforced -- ``TypeB`` need not be a narrower
    form of ``TypeA`` (it can even be a wider form) and this may lead to
    type-unsafe results.  The main reason is to allow for things like
    narrowing ``List[object]`` to ``List[str]`` even though the latter is not
    a subtype of the former, since ``List`` is invariant.  The responsibility of
    writing type-safe type guards is left to the user.

    ``TypeGuard`` also works with type variables.  For more information, see
    PEP 647 (User-Defined Type Guards).

    Usage::

    Type variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type
    checkers.  They serve as the parameters for generic types as well
    as for generic function definitions.  See class Generic for more
    information on generic types.  Generic functions work as follows:

      def repeat(x: T, n: int) -> List[T]:
          '''Return a list containing n references to x.'''
          return [x]*n

      def longest(x: A, y: A) -> A:
          '''Return the longest of two strings.'''
          return x if len(x) >= len(y) else y

    The latter example's signature is essentially the overloading
    of (str, str) -> str and (bytes, bytes) -> bytes.  Also note
    that if the arguments are instances of some subclass of str,
    the return type is still plain str.

    At runtime, isinstance(x, T) and issubclass(C, T) will raise TypeError.

    Type variables defined with covariant=True or contravariant=True
    can be used to declare covariant or contravariant generic types.
    See PEP 484 for more details. By default generic types are invariant
    in all type variables.

    Type variables can be introspected. e.g.:

      T.__name__ == 'T'
      T.__constraints__ == ()
      T.__covariant__ == False
      T.__contravariant__ = False
      A.__constraints__ == (str, bytes)

    Note that only type variables defined in global scope can be pickled.

    Given a ParamSpec object P, P.args is an instance of ParamSpecArgs.

    This type is meant for runtime introspection and has no special meaning to
    static type checkers.

    static type checkers.
    ''.kwargs''Parameter specification variable.

    Usage::

       P = ParamSpec('P')

    Parameter specification variables exist primarily for the benefit of static
    type checkers.  They are used to forward the parameter types of one
    callable to another callable, a pattern commonly found in higher order
    functions and decorators.  They are only valid when used in ``Concatenate``,
    or as the first argument to ``Callable``, or as parameters for user-defined
    Generics.  See class Generic for more information on generic types.  An
    example for annotating a decorator::

       T = TypeVar('T')
       P = ParamSpec('P')

       def add_logging(f: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:
           '''A type-safe decorator to add logging to a function.'''
           def inner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:
               logging.info(f'{f.__name__} was called')
               return f(*args, **kwargs)
           return inner

       @add_logging
       def add_two(x: float, y: float) -> float:
           '''Add two numbers together.'''
           return x + y

    Parameter specification variables defined with covariant=True or
    contravariant=True can be used to declare covariant or contravariant
    generic types.  These keyword arguments are valid, but their actual semantics
    are yet to be decided.  See PEP 612 for details.

    Parameter specification variables can be introspected. e.g.:

       P.__name__ == 'P'
       P.__bound__ == None
       P.__covariant__ == False
       P.__contravariant__ == False

    Note that only parameter specification variables defined in global scope can
    be pickled.

    This represents a generic version of type 'origin' with type arguments 'params'.
    There are two kind of these aliases: user defined and special. The special ones
    are wrappers around builtin collections and ABCs in collections.abc. These must
    have 'name' always set. If 'inst' is False, then the alias can't be instantiated,
    this is used by e.g. typing.List and typing.Dict.

    ''Protocols cannot be instantiated''Allow instance and class checks for special stdlib modules.

    The abc and functools modules indiscriminately call isinstance() and
    issubclass() on the whole MRO of a user class, which may contain protocols.
    ''Instance and class checks can only be used with @runtime_checkable protocols''Base class for protocol classes.

    Protocol classes are defined as::

        class Proto(Protocol):
            def meth(self) -> int:
                ...

    Such classes are primarily used with static type checkers that recognize
    structural subtyping (static duck-typing), for example::

        class C:
            def meth(self) -> int:
                return 0

        def func(x: Proto) -> int:
            return x.meth()

        func(C())  # Passes static type check

    See PEP 544 for details. Protocol classes decorated with
    @typing.runtime_checkable act as simple-minded runtime protocols that check
    only the presence of given attributes, ignoring their type signatures.
    Protocol classes can be generic, they are defined as::

        class GenProto(Protocol[T]):
            def meth(self) -> T:
                ...
    ''Protocols with non-method members don't support issubclass()''Protocols can only inherit from other protocols, got %r''Runtime representation of an annotated type.

    At its core 'Annotated[t, dec1, dec2, ...]' is an alias for the type 't'
    with extra annotations. The alias behaves like a normal typing alias,
    instantiating is the same as instantiating the underlying type, binding
    it to types is also the same.
    ''typing.Annotated[{}, {}]''Add context specific metadata to a type.

    Example: Annotated[int, runtime_check.Unsigned] indicates to the
    hypothetical runtime_check module that this type is an unsigned int.
    Every other consumer of this type can ignore this metadata and treat
    this type as int.

    The first argument to Annotated must be a valid type.

    Details:

    - It's an error to call `Annotated` with less than two arguments.
    - Nested Annotated are flattened::

        Annotated[Annotated[T, Ann1, Ann2], Ann3] == Annotated[T, Ann1, Ann2, Ann3]

    - Instantiating an annotated type is equivalent to instantiating the
    underlying type::

        Annotated[C, Ann1](5) == C(5)

    - Annotated can be used as a generic type alias::

        Optimized = Annotated[T, runtime.Optimize()]
        Optimized[int] == Annotated[int, runtime.Optimize()]

        OptimizedList = Annotated[List[T], runtime.Optimize()]
        OptimizedList[int] == Annotated[List[int], runtime.Optimize()]
    ''Type Annotated cannot be instantiated.''Annotated[...] should be used with at least two arguments (a type and an annotation).''Annotated[t, ...]: t must be a type.''Cannot subclass {}.Annotated''Mark a protocol class as a runtime protocol.

    Such protocol can be used with isinstance() and issubclass().
    Raise TypeError if applied to a non-protocol class.
    This allows a simple-minded structural check very similar to
    one trick ponies in collections.abc such as Iterable.
    For example::

        @runtime_checkable
        class Closable(Protocol):
            def close(self): ...

        assert isinstance(open('/some/file'), Closable)

    Warning: this will check only the presence of the required methods,
    not their type signatures!
    ''@runtime_checkable can be only applied to protocol classes, got %r''Cast a value to a type.

    This returns the value unchanged.  To the type checker this
    signals that the return value has the designated type, but at
    runtime we intentionally don't check anything (we want this
    to be as fast as possible).
    ''Internal helper to extract the default arguments, by name.''Return type hints for an object.

    This is often the same as obj.__annotations__, but it handles
    forward references encoded as string literals, adds Optional[t] if a
    default value equal to None is set and recursively replaces all
    'Annotated[T, ...]' with 'T' (unless 'include_extras=True').

    The argument may be a module, class, method, or function. The annotations
    are returned as a dictionary. For classes, annotations include also
    inherited members.

    TypeError is raised if the argument is not of a type that can contain
    annotations, and an empty dictionary is returned if no annotations are
    present.

    BEWARE -- the behavior of globalns and localns is counterintuitive
    (unless you are familiar with how eval() and exec() work).  The
    search order is locals first, then globals.

    - If no dict arguments are passed, an attempt is made to use the
      globals from obj (or the respective module's globals for classes),
      and these are also used as the locals.  If the object does not appear
      to have globals, an empty dictionary is used.  For classes, the search
      order is globals first then locals.

    - If one dict argument is passed, it is used for both globals and
      locals.

    - If two dict arguments are passed, they specify globals and
      locals, respectively.

    Usage in Python versions >= 3.6::

        class Employee(NamedTuple):

            id: int

    This is equivalent to::

        Employee = collections.namedtuple('Employee', ['name', 'id'])

    The resulting class has an extra __annotations__ attribute, giving a
    dict that maps field names to types.  (The field names are also in
    the _fields attribute, which is part of the namedtuple API.)
    Alternative equivalent keyword syntax is also accepted::

        Employee = NamedTuple('Employee', name=str, id=int)

    In Python versions <= 3.5 use::

        Employee = NamedTuple('Employee', [('name', str), ('id', int)])
    ''Either list of fields or keywords can be provided to NamedTuple, not both''Multiple inheritance with NamedTuple is not supported''Create new typed dict class object.

        This method is called when TypedDict is subclassed,
        or when TypedDict is instantiated. This way
        TypedDict supports all three syntax forms described in its docstring.
        Subclasses and instances of TypedDict return actual dictionaries.

At runtime it is equivalent to a plain dict.

    TypedDict creates a dictionary type that expects all of its
    instances to have a certain set of keys, where each key is
    associated with a value of a consistent type. This expectation
    is not checked at runtime but is only enforced by type checkers.
    Usage::

        class Point2D(TypedDict):
            x: int
            y: int
            label: str

        a: Point2D = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'label': 'good'}  # OK
        b: Point2D = {'z': 3, 'label': 'bad'}           # Fails type check

        assert Point2D(x=1, y=2, label='first') == dict(x=1, y=2, label='first')

    The type info can be accessed via the Point2D.__annotations__ dict, and
    the Point2D.__required_keys__ and Point2D.__optional_keys__ frozensets.
    TypedDict supports two additional equivalent forms::

        Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', x=int, y=int, label=str)
        Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int, 'label': str})

    By default, all keys must be present in a TypedDict. It is possible
    to override this by specifying totality.
    Usage::

        class point2D(TypedDict, total=False):
            x: int
            y: int

    This means that a point2D TypedDict can have any of the keys omitted.A type
    checker is only expected to support a literal False or True as the value of
    the total argument. True is the default, and makes all items defined in the
    class body be required.

    The class syntax is only supported in Python 3.6+, while two other
    syntax forms work for Python 2.7 and 3.2+
    ''TypedDict takes either a dict or keyword arguments, but not both''NewType creates simple unique types with almost zero
    runtime overhead. NewType(name, tp) is considered a subtype of tp
    by static type checkers. At runtime, NewType(name, tp) returns
    a dummy callable that simply returns its argument. Usage::

        UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

        def name_by_id(user_id: UserId) -> str:
            ...

        UserId('user')          # Fails type check

    Objects derived from this class monitor a collection of subprocesses and
    report their termination or interruption by a signal.

    New callbacks are registered with .add_child_handler(). Starting a new
    process must be done within a 'with' block to allow the watcher to suspend
    its activity until the new process if fully registered (this is needed to
    prevent a race condition in some implementations).

    Example:
        with watcher:
            proc = subprocess.Popen("sleep 1")
            watcher.add_child_handler(proc.pid, callback)

    Notes:
        Implementations of this class must be thread-safe.

        Since child watcher objects may catch the SIGCHLD signal and call
        waitpid(-1), there should be only one active object per process.

    This child watcher polls process file descriptors (pidfds) to await child
    process termination. In some respects, PidfdChildWatcher is a "Goldilocks"
    child watcher implementation. It doesn't require signals or threads, doesn't
    interfere with any processes launched outside the event loop, and scales
    linearly with the number of subprocesses launched by the event loop. The
    main disadvantage is that pidfds are specific to Linux, and only work on
    recent (5.3+) kernels.

    This implementation avoids disrupting other code spawning processes by
    polling explicitly each process in the SIGCHLD handler instead of calling
    os.waitpid(-1).

    This is a safe solution but it has a significant overhead when handling a
    big number of children (O(n) each time SIGCHLD is raised)
    ''process %s exited with returncode %s''Unknown child process pid %d, will report returncode 255''Child watcher got an unexpected pid: %r'''Fast' child watcher implementation.

    This implementation reaps every terminated processes by calling

    and waiting for their termination.

    There is no noticeable overhead when handling a big number of children
    (O(1) each time a child terminates).

This module exports three objects:
- zipimporter: a class; its constructor takes a path to a Zip archive.
- ZipImportError: exception raised by zipimporter objects. It's a
  subclass of ImportError, so it can be caught as ImportError, too.
- _zip_directory_cache: a dict, mapping archive paths to zip directory
  info dicts, as used in zipimporter._files.

It is usually not needed to use the zipimport module explicitly; it is
used by the builtin import mechanism for sys.path items that are paths
to Zip archives.
''ZipImportError''zipimporter(archivepath) -> zipimporter object

    Create a new zipimporter instance. 'archivepath' must be a path to
    a zipfile, or to a specific path inside a zipfile. For example, it can be
    '/tmp/myimport.zip', or '/tmp/myimport.zip/mydirectory', if mydirectory is a
    valid directory inside the archive.

    'ZipImportError is raised if 'archivepath' doesn't point to a valid Zip
    archive.

    The 'archive' attribute of zipimporter objects contains the name of the
    zipfile targeted.
    ''archive path is empty''not a Zip file''find_loader(fullname, path=None) -> self, str or None.

        Search for a module specified by 'fullname'. 'fullname' must be the
        fully qualified (dotted) module name. It returns the zipimporter
        instance itself if the module was found, a string containing the
        full path name if it's possibly a portion of a namespace package,
        or None otherwise. The optional 'path' argument is ignored -- it's
        there for compatibility with the importer protocol.

        Deprecated since Python 3.10. Use find_spec() instead.
        ''zipimporter.find_loader() is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.12; use find_spec() instead''find_module(fullname, path=None) -> self or None.

        Search for a module specified by 'fullname'. 'fullname' must be the
        fully qualified (dotted) module name. It returns the zipimporter
        instance itself if the module was found, or None if it wasn't.
        The optional 'path' argument is ignored -- it's there for compatibility

        ''zipimporter.find_module() is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.12; use find_spec() instead''Create a ModuleSpec for the specified module.

        Returns None if the module cannot be found.
        ''get_code(fullname) -> code object.

        Return the code object for the specified module. Raise ZipImportError
        if the module couldn't be imported.
        ''get_data(pathname) -> string with file data.

        Return the data associated with 'pathname'. Raise OSError if
        the file wasn't found.
        ''get_filename(fullname) -> filename string.

        Return the filename for the specified module or raise ZipImportError
        if it couldn't be imported.
        ''get_source(fullname) -> source string.

        Return the source code for the specified module. Raise ZipImportError
        if the module couldn't be found, return None if the archive does
        contain the module, but has no source for it.
        ''can't find module ''is_package(fullname) -> bool.

        Return True if the module specified by fullname is a package.
        Raise ZipImportError if the module couldn't be found.
        ''load_module(fullname) -> module.

        Load the module specified by 'fullname'. 'fullname' must be the

    A pathlib-compatible interface for zip files.

    Consider a zip file with this structure::

        .
         a.txt
         b
             c.txt
             d
                 e.txt

    >>> data = io.BytesIO()
    >>> zf = ZipFile(data, 'w')
    >>> zf.writestr('a.txt', 'content of a')
    >>> zf.writestr('b/c.txt', 'content of c')
    >>> zf.writestr('b/d/e.txt', 'content of e')
    >>> zf.filename = 'mem/abcde.zip'

    Path accepts the zipfile object itself or a filename

    >>> root = Path(zf)

    From there, several path operations are available.

    Directory iteration (including the zip file itself):

    >>> a, b = root.iterdir()
    >>> a
    Path('mem/abcde.zip', 'a.txt')
    >>> b
    Path('mem/abcde.zip', 'b/')

    name property:

    >>> b.name
    'b'

    join with divide operator:

    >>> c = b / 'c.txt'
    >>> c
    Path('mem/abcde.zip', 'b/c.txt')
    >>> c.name
    'c.txt'

    Read text:

    >>> c.read_text()
    'content of c'

    existence:

    >>> c.exists()
    True
    >>> (b / 'missing.txt').exists()
    False

    Coercion to string:

    >>> import os
    >>> str(c).replace(os.sep, posixpath.sep)
    'mem/abcde.zip/b/c.txt'

    At the root, ``name``, ``filename``, and ``parent``
    resolve to the zipfile. Note these attributes are not
    valid and will raise a ``ValueError`` if the zipfile
    has no filename.

    >>> root.name
    'abcde.zip'
    >>> str(root.filename).replace(os.sep, posixpath.sep)
    'mem/abcde.zip'
    >>> str(root.parent)

Convert a function to be a static method.

A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
To declare a static method, use this idiom:

     class C:
         @staticmethod
         def f(arg1, arg2, ...):
             ...

It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
(e.g. C().f()). Both the class and the instance are ignored, and

Convert a function to be a class method.

A class method receives the class as implicit first argument,
just like an instance method receives the instance.
To declare a class method, use this idiom:

  class C:
      @classmethod
      def f(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
          ...

It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
(e.g. C().f()).  The instance is ignored except for its class.
If a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class
object is passed as the implied first argument.

Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods.
If you want those, see the staticmethod builtin.''classmethod.__isabstractmethod__''module.__annotations__''Create a module object.

int(x, base=10) -> integer

Convert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments
are given.  If x is a number, return x.__int__().  For floating point
numbers, this truncates towards zero.

If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the
given base.  The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded
by whitespace.  The base defaults to 10.  Valid bases are 0 and 2-36.
Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal.

interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

Dynamic objects:

argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
  To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
  top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.

stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
  By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
  to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
  These three are only available in an interactive session after a
  traceback has been printed.

Static objects:

builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
float_info -- a named tuple with information about the float implementation.
float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
hash_info -- a named tuple with information about the hash algorithm.
hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
implementation -- Python implementation information.
int_info -- a named tuple with information about the int implementation.
maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
platform -- platform identifier
prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
thread_info -- a named tuple with information about the thread implementation.

encoding gives the name of the encoding that the stream will be
decoded or encoded with. It defaults to locale.getpreferredencoding(False).

errors determines the strictness of encoding and decoding (see
help(codecs.Codec) or the documentation for codecs.register) and
defaults to "strict".

newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '',
'\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as follows:

* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
  enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.

* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any
  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
  to the given string.

If line_buffering is True, a call to flush is implied when a call to
write contains a newline character.''TextIOWrapper.closed''TextIOWrapper.errors''TextIOWrapper.name''TextIOWrapper.newlines''Base class for text I/O.

This class provides a character and line based interface to stream
I/O. There is no readinto method because Python's character strings
are immutable.

''_TextIOBase.newlines''_IOBase.__dict__''The abstract base class for all I/O classes.

This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
may raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are
called.

The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
bytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.
In some cases (such as readinto), a writable object is required. Text
I/O classes work with str data.

Note that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),
which are ignored) on a closed stream should raise a ValueError.

IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
stream.

IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:

with open('spam.txt', 'r') as fp:

A buffered reader object and buffered writer object put together to

reader and writer are RawIOBase objects that are readable and
writeable respectively. If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to

The main difference with RawIOBase is that the read() method

In addition, read(), readinto() and write() may raise
BlockingIOError if the underlying raw stream is in non-blocking
mode and not ready; unlike their raw counterparts, they will never
return None.

Create a compressor object for compressing data incrementally.

format specifies the container format to use for the output. This can
be FORMAT_XZ (default), FORMAT_ALONE, or FORMAT_RAW.

check specifies the integrity check to use. For FORMAT_XZ, the default
is CHECK_CRC64. FORMAT_ALONE and FORMAT_RAW do not support integrity
checks; for these formats, check must be omitted, or be CHECK_NONE.

The settings used by the compressor can be specified either as a
preset compression level (with the 'preset' argument), or in detail
as a custom filter chain (with the 'filters' argument). For FORMAT_XZ
and FORMAT_ALONE, the default is to use the PRESET_DEFAULT preset
level. For FORMAT_RAW, the caller must always specify a filter chain;
the raw compressor does not support preset compression levels.

preset (if provided) should be an integer in the range 0-9, optionally
OR-ed with the constant PRESET_EXTREME.

filters (if provided) should be a sequence of dicts. Each dict should
have an entry for "id" indicating the ID of the filter, plus
additional entries for options to the filter.

The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given
protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The default
protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and is incompatible
with previous versions.

Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol
version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the
version of Python needed to read the pickle produced.

The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a single
bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for binary
writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets
this interface.

If *fix_imports* is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try
to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python
2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.

If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
(such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

It is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*
is None or smaller than 5.''Pickler.memo''Pickler.persistent_id''This takes a binary file for reading a pickle data stream.

The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no
protocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's
representation are ignored.

The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that takes
an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no
arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file* can be a
binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any
other custom object that meets this interface.

Optional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,
which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream
generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to
map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The
*encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string
instances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',
respectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit
string instances as bytes objects.''Unpickler.memo''Unpickler.persistent_load''Optimized C implementation for the Python pickle module.''/home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/_pickle.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so''POSIX shared memory module''/home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/_posixshmem.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so''A POSIX helper for the subprocess module.''/home/wyu3/anaconda3/envs/sr/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload/_posixsubprocess.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so''Empty.__weakref__''Simple, unbounded, reentrant FIFO queue.''C implementation of the Python queue module.

''struct format string''Struct.format''struct size in bytes''Struct.size''Functions to convert between Python values and C structs.
Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.

Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes
    'b'         signed integer     1
    'B'         unsigned integer   1
    'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note)
    'h'         signed integer     2
    'H'         unsigned integer   2
    'i'         signed integer     2
    'I'         unsigned integer   2
    'l'         signed integer     4
    'L'         unsigned integer   4
    'q'         signed integer     8 (see note)
    'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note)
    'f'         floating point     4
    'd'         floating point     8

NOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On
narrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.

NOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform
C compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,
'__int64'.

Methods:

append() -- append a new item to the end of the array
buffer_info() -- return information giving the current memory info
byteswap() -- byteswap all the items of the array
count() -- return number of occurrences of an object
extend() -- extend array by appending multiple elements from an iterable

Cartesian product of input iterables.  Equivalent to nested for-loops.

For example, product(A, B) returns the same as:  ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).
The leftmost iterators are in the outermost for-loop, so the output tuples
cycle in a manner similar to an odometer (with the rightmost element changing
on every iteration).

To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number
of repetitions with the optional repeat keyword argument. For example,
product(A, repeat=4) means the same as product(A, A, A, A).

product('ab', range(3)) --> ('a',0) ('a',1) ('a',2) ('b',0) ('b',1) ('b',2)

Return a zip_longest object whose .__next__() method returns a tuple where
the i-th element comes from the i-th iterable argument.  The .__next__()
method continues until the longest iterable in the argument sequence
is exhausted and then it raises StopIteration.  When the shorter iterables
are exhausted, the fillvalue is substituted in their place.  The fillvalue
defaults to None or can be specified by a keyword argument.
''pgen2.literals''This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in
a binary format. The format is specific to Python, but independent of
machine architecture issues.

Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects
whose value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be
written and read by this module. The following types are supported:
None, integers, floating point numbers, strings, bytes, bytearrays,
tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, and code objects, where it
should be understood that tuples, lists and dictionaries are only
supported as long as the values contained therein are themselves
supported; and recursive lists and dictionaries should not be written
(they will cause infinite loops).

Variables:

version -- indicates the format that the module uses. Version 0 is the
    historical format, version 1 shares interned strings and version 2
    uses a binary format for floating point numbers.
    Version 3 shares common object references (New in version 3.4).

Functions:

There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.
The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).

The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (including century, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.
''The time value as returned by gmtime(), localtime(), and strptime(), and
 accepted by asctime(), mktime() and strftime().  May be considered as a
 sequence of 9 integers.
