It opens the image, scales it by each scaling factor, displays each scaled image using matplotlib, and returns a list of tuples containing the Axes and the pixel values of the scaled image. The function raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the image file does not exist. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function and print the scaling factor and the shape of each scaled image."}

The function takes three parameters: `length`, `range_limit`, and `seed`. It checks if `range_limit` is valid and raises a `ValueError` if it's less than or equal to 1. The function returns the axes object and the list of random numbers. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function."}

It generates a spiral by calculating the corresponding radii and angles, then plots the spiral on the given axes. The radial ticks are set at intervals corresponding to the number of turns multiplied by 45 degrees. The aspect ratio of the plot is set to be equal so the spiral appears as a spiral. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function to draw a spiral with 3 turns."}

It first checks if the group name exists in the dataframe and raises a `ValueError` if it does not. Then, it filters the dataframe for the specified group and creates a bar plot using matplotlib.

It checks for the existence of the image file and validates the threshold value. If the image file does not exist or the threshold is invalid, it raises a `FileNotFoundError` or `ValueError` respectively. Otherwise, it reads the image using OpenCV, converts it to grayscale, and binarizes it using the given threshold. The function returns a tuple containing the original grayscale image and the binarized image as numpy arrays. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and handle potential exceptions."}

It checks if the source and destination directories exist, then uses `glob` to find files with the specified extension in the source directory. It iterates over the files, checks if they already exist in the destination directory, and moves them if not. The function returns a list of the full paths of the moved files. If either the source or destination directory does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`."}

It raises a `ValueError` if the input data is empty and a `TypeError` if the input is not a list of dictionaries or if any value in the dictionaries is not numeric. The function returns a dictionary with keys and their corresponding mean and standard deviation, and a list of matplotlib Axes objects. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the results."}

The `curve_fit` function uses a sine function with four parameters: amplitude, frequency, phase shift, and vertical shift. The initial guess for the parameters is set to [1, 1, 0, 0], which is a reasonable starting point for a sine wave. The adjusted curve is then plotted along with the noisy sine wave and the original sine wave."}

The names are randomly selected from two lists, one of Latin names and one of English names. The function takes several arguments, including the name of the CSV file to be created, the lists of Latin and English names, the encoding to use, and a random seed. It checks if the input arguments are of the correct type and raises a `TypeError` if they are not. The function returns the name of the created CSV file."}

It takes three arguments: `file_path`, `num_rows`, and `random_seed`. The function checks if `num_rows` is a non-negative integer and raises a `ValueError` if it's not. It then generates the CSV data using the `Faker` library and writes it to the specified file path. The function returns the file path of the generated CSV file. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function and print the contents of the generated CSV file."}

It uses the `glob` module to find files with each extension in the directory and its subdirectories, counts the number of files, and returns a `Counter` object with the file counts. If `keep_zero` is `False`, it removes extensions with zero count from the output. The function raises an `OSError` if the specified directory does not exist. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and handle the `OSError` exception."}

It checks if the directory exists and is a directory, and if the predicates are provided. It then deduplicates the predicates and evaluates each item in the directory against each predicate. The results are stored in a dictionary, which is returned by the function.\n\nThe script also includes three example predicates: `is_uppercase`, `contains_digit`, and `contains_vowel`. You can replace these with your own predicates as needed.\n\nNote that this script uses the `os` module to interact with the file system and the `pathlib` module to work with paths. The `re` module is not used in this script, but it could be used if you need to use regular expressions in your predicates."}

It then splits the text into words and calculates their lengths. The script creates a histogram of word lengths and calculates the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the word lengths. The histogram and KDE are plotted on the same axes, with the histogram shown in a semi-transparent style to allow for easier comparison with the KDE. The plot title, x-axis label, and y-axis label are set accordingly. The function returns the Axes object, which can be used to further customize the plot."}

The function raises a ValueError in the following scenarios:\n\n1.  If the URL is invalid or the XML file cannot be fetched from the URL.\n2.  If the XML file has invalid syntax.\n3.  If the XML structure does not conform to the expected format.\n\nThe expected XML structure is defined in the `expected_structure` dictionary, which specifies the expected child elements of the 'item' element. The function iterates over all 'item' elements in the XML tree, extracts the text content of the expected child elements, and constructs a Pandas DataFrame from the parsed data.\n\nNote that this script assumes that the XML file has a structure similar to the following:\n```xml\n<root>\n    <item>\n        <name>Item 1</name>\n        <price>10.99</price>\n        <description>This is item 1</description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n        <name>Item 2</name>\n        <price>9.99</price>\n        <description>This is item 2</description>\n    </item>\n</root>\n```\nYou can modify the `expected_structure` dictionary to match the actual structure of your XML file."}
